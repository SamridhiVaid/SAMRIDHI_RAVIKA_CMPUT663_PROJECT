Remarks: The StringValidator class is used to ensure that a string meets specific criteria. The criteria for validation is established when an instance of the StringValidator class is created. There are three constructor overloads for the StringValidator class. The StringValidator.StringValidator(Int32) constructor with one parameter verifies the minimum acceptable length of the string being validated. The StringValidator.StringValidator(Int32, Int32) constructor with two parameters ensures that the string being verified adheres to both a minimum and a maximum length. The StringValidator.StringValidator(Int32, Int32, String) constructor with three parameters checks both the minimum and the maximum length values of the string being verified, as well as whether specific characters are present in the string being validated. The CanValidate method determines whether the object type being validated matches the expected type. The object being validated is passed as a parameter of the Validate method.

Remarks: The DataTypeAttribute attribute enables you to mark fields by using a type that is more specific than the database intrinsic type. The type name is selected from the DataType enumeration type. For example, a string data field that contains e-mail addresses can be specified as the EmailAddress type. This information is then accessed by the field templates to modify how the data field is processed. You use the DataTypeAttribute attribute for the following reasons: To provide additional type information for a data field. You do this by applying the DataTypeAttribute attribute to a data field in the data model and by specifying the additional type name from the DataType enumeration. The field template that processes the data field can access this additional metadata type information to determine how to process the field. For example, the text field template can generate hyperlinks for e-mail addresses whose intrinsic type is String. To associate a custom field template with a data field. The specified custom field template will then be used to process the data field. This is an alternative to using the UIHintAttribute attribute. When you apply the DataTypeAttribute attribute to a data field you must do the following: Follow the attribute usage rules. Implement the metadata class that contains the data fields to which you want to apply the attribute. Issue validation errors as appropriate. For more information, see ASP.NET Dynamic Data Guidelines. See a run-time code example of this feature: Run. Example: The following example uses the DataTypeAttribute attribute to customize the display of the EmailAddress data field. The e-mail addresses are shown as hyperlinks instead of as simple text, which is what Dynamic Data would infer from the intrinsic data type. The example code is in three parts, and it performs the following steps: It implements a metadata partial class and the associated metadata class. In the associated metadata class, it applies the DataTypeAttribute attribute to the EmailAddress data field by specifying the EmailAddress enumerated value. This indicates to the Text.ascx field template that it should customize the display of e-mail addresses. It modifies the Text.ascx field template to customize the display of the EmailAddress data fields.    <%@ Control Language=## CodeFile=#Text.ascx.cs# Inherits=#TextField# %> <!-- Removed, evaluated in the code behind. <%\# FieldValueString %> -->    To compile and run the example code, you need the following: Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1 or Visual Developer 2008 Express Edition Service Pack 1.

For example, if company X has three initializers, it could define the  following properties:     * org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass.com.x.Init1     * org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass.com.x.Init2     * org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass.com.x.Init3 During ORB.init, these ORB properties which begin with  org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass shall be collected, the  <Service> portion of each property shall be extracted, an object shall be  instantiated with the <Service> string as its class name, and the pre_init  and post_init methods shall be called on that object. If there are any  exceptions, the ORB shall ignore them and proceed.  Example  A client-side logging service written by company X, for example, may have  the following ORBInitializer implementation:   package com.x.logging; import org.omg.PortableInterceptor.Interceptor; import org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializer; import org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitInfo; public class LoggingService implements ORBInitializer { void pre_init( ORBInitInfo info ) { // Instantiate the Logging Service s Interceptor. Interceptor interceptor = new LoggingInterceptor(); // Register the Logging Service s Interceptor. info.add_client_request_interceptor( interceptor ); } void post_init( ORBInitInfo info ) { // This service does not need two init points. } }   To run a program called MyApp using this logging service, the user could  type:      java     -Dorg.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass.com.x.Logging.LoggingService     MyApp  Notes about Registering Interceptors  Request Interceptors are registered on a per-ORB basis.  To achieve virtual per-object Interceptors, query the policies on the  target from within the interception points to determine whether they should  do any work.  To achieve virtual per-POA Interceptors, instantiate each POA with a  different ORB. While Interceptors may be ordered administratively, there is  no concept of order with respect to the registration of Interceptors.  Request Interceptors are concerned with service contexts. Service contexts  have no order, so there is no purpose for request Interceptors to have an  order. IOR Interceptors are concerned with tagged components. Tagged  components also have no order, so there is no purpose for IOR Interceptors  to have an order.  Registration code should avoid using the ORB (i.e., calling ORB.init with  the provided orb_id). Since registration occurs during ORB initialization,  results of invocations on this ORB while it is in this state are undefined.  See Also:     ORBInitInfo",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,6,518,clean

The other methods  more specifically support interaction with input methods: They let client  components control the behavior of input methods, and dispatch events from  the client component to the input method.  By default, one InputContext instance is created per Window instance, and  this input context is shared by all components within the window's  container hierarchy. However, this means that only one text input operation  is possible at any one time within a window, and that the text needs to be  committed when moving the focus from one text component to another. If this  is not desired, text components can create their own input context  instances.  The Java Platform supports input methods that have been developed in the  Java programming language, using the interfaces in the java.awt.im.spi  package, and installed into a Java SE Runtime Environment as extensions.  Implementations may also support using the native input methods of the  platforms they run on; however, not all platforms and locales provide input  methods. Keyboard layouts are provided by the host platform.

Tasks scheduled for exactly the same execution time are enabled  in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order of submission.  While this class inherits from ThreadPoolExecutor, a few of the inherited  tuning methods are not useful for it.

Extension notes: This class overrides AbstractExecutorService submit  methods to generate internal objects to control per-task delays and  scheduling.

Remarks: You can use client application services to retrieve role information from an existing roles service by configuring your application to use the ClientRoleProvider class. After configuration, you can determine whether an authenticated user is in a particular role by calling the IsInRole method of the IPrincipal returned by the static Thread.CurrentPrincipal property. For applications configured to use client application services, this property returns a ClientRolePrincipal. Because this class implements the IPrincipal interface, you do not need to reference it explicitly. The ClientRolePrincipal.IsInRole method internally calls the ClientRoleProvider.IsUserInRole method. The ClientRoleProvider class is a read-only role membership provider that retrieves role information for authenticated users from the roles service indicated by the ServiceUri property. The value of the ServiceUri property is typically retrieved from the application configuration file along with other configuration values. For more information, see How to: Configure Client Application Services. You can retrieve the current ClientRoleProvider instance through the static Roles.Provider property. The ClientRoleProvider class supports only the GetRolesForUser and IsUserInRole methods of the RoleProvider abstract class. When you call one of these methods for a particular user, the service provider first checks the local data cache for role information. If the cache does not contain any role information or the cache has expired, the service provider retrieves the role information from the roles service and adds it to the cache. You can specify the time-out period for the roles cache when you configure client application services. To force the GetRolesForUser method to retrieve role data from the service instead of the local cache, call the ResetCache method first. You cannot use the ClientRoleProvider class to create or delete roles, or to modify the role membership of users. To create or modify role information, you must change the configuration of the role service on the server. Example: The following example code demonstrates how to use this property to programmatically set the roles service location.

128,33641,489694,493438,8,public interface BodyTag   ,"The BodyTag interface extends IterationTag by defining additional methods  that let a tag handler manipulate the content of evaluating its body.  It is the responsibility of the tag handler to manipulate the body content.  For example the tag handler may take the body content, convert it into a  String using the bodyContent.getString method and then use it. Or the tag  handler may take the body content and write it out into its enclosing  JspWriter using the bodyContent.writeOut method.  A tag handler that implements BodyTag is treated as one that implements  IterationTag, except that the doStartTag method can return SKIP_BODY,  EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE or EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED.  If EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE is returned, then evaluation happens as in  IterationTag.  If EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED is returned, then a BodyContent object will be  created (by code generated by the JSP compiler) to capture the body  evaluation. The code generated by the JSP compiler obtains the BodyContent  object by calling the pushBody method of the current pageContext, which  additionally has the effect of saving the previous out value. The page  compiler returns this object by calling the popBody method of the  PageContext class; the call also restores the value of out.  The interface provides one new property with a setter method and one new  action method.  Properties  There is a new property: bodyContent, to contain the BodyContent object,  where the JSP Page implementation object will place the evaluation (and  reevaluation, if appropriate) of the body. The setter method  (setBodyContent) will only be invoked if doStartTag() returns  EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED and the corresponding action element does not have an  empty body.  Methods  In addition to the setter method for the bodyContent property, there is a  new action method: doInitBody(), which is invoked right after  setBodyContent() and before the body evaluation. This method is only  invoked if doStartTag() returns EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED.  Lifecycle  Lifecycle details are described by the transition diagram below. Exceptions  that are thrown during the computation of doStartTag(), setBodyContent(),  doInitBody(), BODY, doAfterBody() interrupt the execution sequence and are  propagated up the stack, unless the tag handler implements the  TryCatchFinally interface; see that interface for details.  [Lifecycle Details Transition Diagram for BodyTag]  Empty and Non-Empty Action  If the TagLibraryDescriptor file indicates that the action must always have  an empty element body, by an <body-content> entry of empty, then the  doStartTag() method must return SKIP_BODY. Otherwise, the doStartTag()  method may return SKIP_BODY, EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE, or EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED.  Note that which methods are invoked after the doStartTag() depends on both  the return value and on if the custom action element is empty or not in the  JSP page, not how it's declared in the TLD.  If SKIP_BODY is returned the body is not evaluated, and doEndTag() is  invoked.  If EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE is returned, and the custom action element is not  empty, setBodyContent() is not invoked, doInitBody() is not invoked, the  body is evaluated and passed through to the current out, doAfterBody() is  invoked and then, after zero or more iterations, doEndTag() is invoked. If  the custom action element is empty, only doStart() and doEndTag() are  invoked.  If EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED is returned, and the custom action element is not  empty, setBodyContent() is invoked, doInitBody() is invoked, the body is  evaluated, doAfterBody() is invoked, and then, after zero or more  iterations, doEndTag() is invoked.

Remarks: Instances of the AssemblyBuilder class are used with BuildProvider class methods to build one or more files into a compiled assembly. The BuildProvider class defines build functionality for individual files, and the AssemblyBuilder class combines the source code contributed by each BuildProvider instance into a single assembly. The ASP.NET build environment passes an AssemblyBuilder object to the BuildProvider methods when building an assembly from one or more files, so that each BuildProvider instance can contribute source code for its file to the overall assembly. The ASP.NET build environment determines the language and compiler required by files within the project, based on the BuildProvider.CodeCompilerType property. The build environment groups files based on their compiler settings and builds an assembly from files that require the same compiler. The CodeDomProvider property indicates the CodeDomProvider implementation that the ASP.NET build environment uses to compile an assembly from the source code contributed by each BuildProvider implementation. A BuildProvider object contributes source code in the form of a CodeDOM graph using the AddCodeCompileUnit method. A BuildProvider object contributes source code stored in a physical file using the CreateCodeFile method. After each BuildProvider object contributes source code using the appropriate AssemblyBuilder methods, the ASP.NET build environment uses the AssemblyBuilder class to compile the collected source code into an assembly. Topic Location How To: Secure an ASP.NET Application on a Shared Server Building ASP .NET Web Applications How To: Secure an ASP.NET Application on a Shared Server Building ASP .NET Web Applications Example: The following code example illustrates a simple build provider implementation, inheriting from the abstract BuildProvider base class.

Remarks: The MailFileEditor class is an UITypeEditor object that can be used at design time to select and edit a mail file name as a string, and assign the string to a control property. For example, the EmbeddedMailObject control uses the MailFileEditor class at design time to set the value of the Path property. Use the EditorAttribute attribute to associate the MailFileEditor with a property. When the associated property is edited in the design surface, the designer host calls the EditValue method. The EditValue method displays a dialog box for selecting a mail file name from a filtered list of files, and returns the file name that is selected by the user. The GetEditStyle method indicates the display style of the user interface. Derive a class from the MailFileEditor to define a custom editor for a mail file name property. For example, a derived class can override the EditValue method, and display an OpenFileDialog instance with a custom mail file filter or title. Example: The following code example demonstrates how to associate an instance of the MailFileEditor class with a property that is contained within a custom control.

For information about using  JOptionPane, see How to Make Dialogs, a section in The Java Tutorial.  While the JOptionPane class may appear complex because of the large number  of methods, almost all uses of this class are one-line calls to one of the  static showXxxDialog methods shown below:      Method Name 	Description     showConfirmDialog 	Asks a confirming question, like yes/no/cancel.     showInputDialog 	Prompt for some input.     showMessageDialog 	Tell the user about something that has happened.     showOptionDialog 	The Grand Unification of the above three.  Each of these methods also comes in a showInternalXXX flavor, which uses an  internal frame to hold the dialog box (see JInternalFrame). Multiple  convenience methods have also been defined -- overloaded versions of the  basic methods that use different parameter lists.  All dialogs are modal. Each showXxxDialog method blocks the caller until  the user's interaction is complete.  icon 	message input value option buttons The basic appearance of one of these dialog boxes is generally similar to  the picture at the right, although the various look-and-feels are  ultimately responsible for the final result. In particular, the  look-and-feels will adjust the layout to accommodate the option pane's  ComponentOrientation property.  Parameters: The parameters to these methods follow consistent patterns:      parentComponent         Defines the Component that is to be the parent of this dialog box.         It is used in two ways: the Frame that contains it is used as the          Frame parent for the dialog box, and its screen coordinates are         used in the placement of the dialog box. In general, the dialog box         is placed just below the component. This parameter may be null, in         which case a default Frame is used as the parent, and the dialog         will be centered on the screen (depending on the L&F).     message         A descriptive message to be placed in the dialog box. In the most         common usage, message is just a String or String constant. However,         the type of this parameter is actually Object. Its interpretation         depends on its type:         Object[]             An array of objects is interpreted as a series of messages (one             per object) arranged in a vertical stack. The interpretation is             recursive -- each object in the array is interpreted according             to its type.         Component             The Component is displayed in the dialog.         Icon             The Icon is wrapped in a JLabel and displayed in the dialog.         others             The object is converted to a String by calling its toString              method. The result is wrapped in a JLabel and displayed.     messageType         Defines the style of the message. The Look and Feel manager may lay         out the dialog differently depending on this value, and will often         provide a default icon. The possible values are:             * ERROR_MESSAGE             * INFORMATION_MESSAGE             * WARNING_MESSAGE             * QUESTION_MESSAGE             * PLAIN_MESSAGE     optionType         Defines the set of option buttons that appear at the bottom of the         dialog box:             * DEFAULT_OPTION             * YES_NO_OPTION             * YES_NO_CANCEL_OPTION             * OK_CANCEL_OPTION         You aren't limited to this set of option buttons. You can provide         any buttons you want using the options parameter.     options         A more detailed description of the set of option buttons that will         appear at the bottom of the dialog box. The usual value for the         options parameter is an array of Strings. But the parameter type is         an array of Objects. A button is created for each object depending         on its type:         Component             The component is added to the button row directly.         Icon             A JButton is created with this as its label.         other             The Object is converted to a string using its toString method             and the result is used to label a JButton.     icon         A decorative icon to be placed in the dialog box. A default value         for this is determined by the messageType parameter.     title         The title for the dialog box.     initialValue         The default selection (input value).

Summary: Gets or sets a value specifying the source of complete strings used for automatic completion. Remarks: Use the AutoCompleteCustomSource, AutoCompleteMode, and AutoCompleteSource properties to create a ComboBox that automatically completes input strings by comparing the prefix being entered to the prefixes of all strings in a maintained source. This is useful for ComboBox controls in which URLs, addresses, file names, or commands will be frequently entered. The use of the AutoCompleteCustomSource property is optional, but you must set the AutoCompleteSource property to CustomSource in order to use AutoCompleteCustomSource. You must use the AutoCompleteMode and AutoCompleteSource properties together.

Return Value Type: System.Linq.IQueryable(Of TSource) An IQueryable(Of T) that contains the set difference of the two sequences. Usage Note In Visual Basic and C\#, you can call this method as an instance method on any object of type IQueryable(Of TSource). When you use instance method syntax to call this method, omit the first parameter. For more information, see Extension Methods (Visual Basic) or Extension Methods (C\# Programming Guide). Summary: Produces the set difference of two sequences by using the default equality comparer to compare values. Remarks: The Except(Of TSource)(IQueryable(Of TSource), IEnumerable(Of TSource)) method generates a MethodCallExpression that represents calling Except(Of TSource)(IQueryable(Of TSource), IEnumerable(Of TSource)) itself as a constructed generic method. It then passes the MethodCallExpression to the CreateQuery(Of TElement)(Expression) method of the IQueryProvider represented by the Provider property of thesource1 parameter. The query behavior that occurs as a result of executing an expression tree that represents calling Except(Of TSource)(IQueryable(Of TSource), IEnumerable(Of TSource)) depends on the implementation of the type of the source1 parameter. The expected behavior is that all the elements in source1 are returned except for those that are also in source2.

Newlines     There are two properties which deal with newlines. The system property,      line.separator, is defined to be platform-dependent, either  n,  r,     or  r n.

Remarks: The ListView control raises the ItemInserting event when an Insert button in the control is clicked, but before the ListView control inserts the record. (An Insert button is a button whose CommandName property is set to #Insert#.) This enables you to provide an event-handling method that performs a custom routine whenever this event occurs. For example, you can validate or HTML-encode the values of a record before it is inserted it in the data source. A ListViewInsertEventArgs object is passed to the event-handling method. This object enables you to determine the value of an optional command argument that is sent to the ListView control. You can access the ListViewItem object that is being inserted by using the Item property. You can also read or modify the field values for the new record by using the Values property. To cancel the insert operation, set the Cancel property to true. For a list of initial property values for an instance of the ListViewInsertEventArgs class, see the ListViewInsertEventArgs constructor. Example: The following example shows how to use the ListViewInsertEventArgs object to cancel an insert operation if the data item contains an empty value.

The SpeechRecognizer instance raises a SpeechRecognizer.RecognizerUpdateReached event when it is ready for the update. While a SpeechRecognizer instance is paused, you can load, unload, enable, and disable Grammar objects. When handling SpeechRecognitionEngine.RecognizerUpdateReached and SpeechRecognizer.RecognizerUpdateReached events, a recognition engine pauses until the event handler returns. RecognizerUpdateReachedEventArgs derives from EventArgs. Example: The following example shows a console application that loads and unloads Grammar objects. The application uses the RequestRecognizerUpdate method to request the speech recognition engine to pause so it can receive an update. The application then loads or unloads a Grammar object. At each update, a handler for SpeechRecognitionEngine.RecognizerUpdateReached event writes the name and status of the currently loaded Grammar objects to the console. As grammars are loaded and unloaded, the application first recognizes the names of farm animals, then the names of farm animals and the names of fruits, then only the names of fruits.

177,32841,452739,456483,8,public class MailcapCommandMap   ,"MailcapCommandMap extends the CommandMap abstract class. It implements a  CommandMap whose configuration is based on mailcap files (RFC 1524). The  MailcapCommandMap can be configured both programmatically and via  configuration files.  Mailcap file search order:  The MailcapCommandMap looks in various places in the user's system for  mailcap file entries. When requests are made to search for commands in the  MailcapCommandMap, it searches mailcap files in the following order:     1. Programatically added entries to the MailcapCommandMap instance.    2. The file .mailcap in the user's home directory.    3. The file <java.home>/lib/mailcap.    4. The file or resources named META-INF/mailcap.    5. The file or resource named META-INF/mailcap.default (usually found       only in the activation.jar file).  Mailcap file format:  Mailcap files must conform to the mailcap file specification (RFC 1524, A  User Agent Configuration Mechanism For Multimedia Mail Format Information ). The file format consists of entries corresponding to particular MIME  types. In general, the specification specifies applications for clients to  use when they themselves cannot operate on the specified MIME type. The  MailcapCommandMap extends this specification by using a parameter mechanism  in mailcap files that allows JavaBeans(tm) components to be specified as  corresponding to particular commands for a MIME type.  When a mailcap file is parsed, the MailcapCommandMap recognizes certain  parameter signatures, specifically those parameter names that begin with  x-java-. The MailcapCommandMap uses this signature to find command entries  for inclusion into its registries. Parameter names with the form  x-java-<name> are read by the MailcapCommandMap as identifying a command  with the name name. When the name is content-handler the MailcapCommandMap  recognizes the class signified by this parameter as a DataContentHandler.  All other commands are handled generically regardless of command name. The  command implementation is specified by a fully qualified class name of a  JavaBean(tm) component. For example; a command for viewing some data can be  specified as: x-java-view=com.foo.ViewBean.  When the command name is fallback-entry, the value of the command may be  true or false. An entry for a MIME type that includes a parameter of  x-java-fallback-entry=true defines fallback commands for that MIME type  that will only be used if no non-fallback entry can be found. For example,  an entry of the form text/*; ; x-java-fallback-entry=true;  x-java-view=com.sun.TextViewer specifies a view command to be used for any  text MIME type. This view command would only be used if a non-fallback view  command for the MIME type could not be found.  MailcapCommandMap aware mailcap files have the following general form:  \# Comments begin with a '\#' and continue to the end of the line. <mime type>; ; <parameter list> \# Where a parameter list consists of one or more parameters, \# where parameters look like: x-java-view=com.sun.TextViewer \# and a parameter list looks like: text/plain; ; x-java-view=com.sun.TextViewer; x-java-edit=com.sun.TextEdit \# Note that mailcap entries that do not contain 'x-java' parameters \# and comply to RFC 1524 are simply ignored: image/gif; /usr/dt/bin/sdtimage %s  Since:     1.6",1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,5,512,clean

182,32620,447584,451328,8,public interface ResultSet   ,"A table of data representing a database result set, which is usually  generated by executing a statement that queries the database.  A ResultSet object maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data.  Initially the cursor is positioned before the first row. The next method  moves the cursor to the next row, and because it returns false when there  are no more rows in the ResultSet object, it can be used in a while loop to  iterate through the result set.  A default ResultSet object is not updatable and has a cursor that moves  forward only. Thus, you can iterate through it only once and only from the  first row to the last row. It is possible to produce ResultSet objects that  are scrollable and/or updatable. The following code fragment, in which con  is a valid Connection object, illustrates how to make a result set that is  scrollable and insensitive to updates by others, and that is updatable. See  ResultSet fields for other options.    Statement stmt = con.createStatement( ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE); ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(SELECT a, b FROM TABLE2); // rs will be scrollable, will not show changes made by others, // and will be updatable    The ResultSet interface provides getter methods (getBoolean, getLong, and  so on) for retrieving column values from the current row. Values can be  retrieved using either the index number of the column or the name of the  column. In general, using the column index will be more efficient. Columns  are numbered from 1. For maximum portability, result set columns within  each row should be read in left-to-right order, and each column should be  read only once.  For the getter methods, a JDBC driver attempts to convert the underlying  data to the Java type specified in the getter method and returns a suitable  Java value. The JDBC specification has a table showing the allowable  mappings from SQL types to Java types that can be used by the ResultSet  getter methods.  Column names used as input to getter methods are case insensitive. When a  getter method is called with a column name and several columns have the  same name, the value of the first matching column will be returned. The  column name option is designed to be used when column names are used in the  SQL query that generated the result set. For columns that are NOT  explicitly named in the query, it is best to use column numbers. If column  names are used, the programmer should take care to guarantee that they  uniquely refer to the intended columns, which can be assured with the SQL  AS clause.  A set of updater methods were added to this interface in the JDBC 2.0 API  (JavaTM 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.2). The comments regarding  parameters to the getter methods also apply to parameters to the updater  methods.  The updater methods may be used in two ways:     1. to update a column value in the current row. In a scrollable        ResultSet object, the cursor can be moved backwards and forwards, to       an absolute position, or to a position relative to the current row.       The following code fragment updates the NAME column in the fifth row       of the ResultSet object rs and then uses the method updateRow to       update the data source table from which rs was derived.          rs.absolute(5); // moves the cursor to the fifth row of rs rs.updateString(NAME, AINSWORTH); // updates the // NAME column of row 5 to be AINSWORTH rs.updateRow(); // updates the row in the data source       2. to insert column values into the insert row. An updatable ResultSet        object has a special row associated with it that serves as a staging       area for building a row to be inserted. The following code fragment       moves the cursor to the insert row, builds a three-column row, and       inserts it into rs and into the data source table using the method        insertRow.          rs.moveToInsertRow(); // moves cursor to the insert row rs.updateString(1, AINSWORTH); // updates the // first column of the insert row to be AINSWORTH rs.updateInt(2,35); // updates the second column to be 35 rs.updateBoolean(3, true); // updates the third column to true rs.insertRow(); rs.moveToCurrentRow();    A ResultSet object is automatically closed when the Statement object that  generated it is closed, re-executed, or used to retrieve the next result  from a sequence of multiple results.  The number, types and properties of a ResultSet object's columns are  provided by the ResulSetMetaData object returned by the  ResultSet.getMetaData method.

203,32698,449993,453737,8,"public interface SortedMap<K,V>   ","A Map that further provides a total ordering on its keys. The map is  ordered according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator  typically provided at sorted map creation time. This order is reflected  when iterating over the sorted map's collection views (returned by the  entrySet, keySet and values methods). Several additional operations are  provided to take advantage of the ordering. (This interface is the map  analogue of SortedSet.)  All keys inserted into a sorted map must implement the Comparable  interface (or be accepted by the specified comparator). Furthermore, all  such keys must be mutually comparable: k1.compareTo(k2) (or  comparator.compare(k1, k2)) must not throw a ClassCastException for any  keys k1 and k2 in the sorted map. Attempts to violate this restriction will  cause the offending method or constructor invocation to throw a  ClassCastException.  Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map (whether or not an  explicit comparator is provided) must be consistent with equals if the  sorted map is to correctly implement the Map interface. (See the  Comparable interface or Comparator interface for a precise definition of  consistent with equals.) This is so because the Map interface is defined in  terms of the equals operation, but a sorted map performs all key  comparisons using its compareTo (or compare) method, so two keys that are  deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted map,  equal. The behavior of a tree map is well-defined even if its ordering is  inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general contract of the  Map interface.  All general-purpose sorted map implementation classes should provide four  standard constructors: 1) A void (no arguments) constructor, which  creates an empty sorted map sorted according to the natural ordering of its  keys. 2) A constructor with a single argument of type Comparator, which  creates an empty sorted map sorted according to the specified comparator.  3) A constructor with a single argument of type Map, which creates a new  map with the same key-value mappings as its argument, sorted according to  the keys' natural ordering. 4) A constructor with a single argument of type  SortedMap, which creates a new sorted map with the same key-value mappings  and the same ordering as the input sorted map. There is no way to enforce  this recommendation, as interfaces cannot contain constructors.  Note: several methods return submaps with restricted key ranges. Such  ranges are half-open, that is, they include their low endpoint but not  their high endpoint (where applicable). If you need a closed range (which  includes both endpoints), and the key type allows for calculation of the  successor of a given key, merely request the subrange from lowEndpoint to  successor(highEndpoint). For example, suppose that m is a map whose keys  are strings. The following idiom obtains a view containing all of the  key-value mappings in m whose keys are between low and high, inclusive:   SortedMap<String, V> sub = m.subMap(low, high+ 0);  A similar technique can be used to generate an open range (which contains  neither endpoint). The following idiom obtains a view containing all of the  key-value mappings in m whose keys are between low and high, exclusive:   SortedMap<String, V> sub = m.subMap(low+ 0, high);  This interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework.

JTextArea is different  in that it doesn't manage scrolling, but implements the swing Scrollable  interface. This allows it to be placed inside a JScrollPane if scrolling  behavior is desired, and used directly if scrolling is not desired.  The java.awt.TextArea has the ability to do line wrapping. This was  controlled by the horizontal scrolling policy. Since scrolling is not done  by JTextArea directly, backward compatibility must be provided another way.  JTextArea has a bound property for line wrapping that controls whether or  not it will wrap lines. By default, the line wrapping property is set to  false (not wrapped).  java.awt.TextArea has two properties rows and columns that are used to  determine the preferred size. JTextArea uses these properties to indicate  the preferred size of the viewport when placed inside a JScrollPane to  match the functionality provided by java.awt.TextArea. JTextArea has a  preferred size of what is needed to display all of the text, so that it  functions properly inside of a JScrollPane. If the value for rows or  columns is equal to zero, the preferred size along that axis is used for  the viewport preferred size along the same axis.  The java.awt.TextArea could be monitored for changes by adding a  TextListener for TextEvents. In the JTextComponent based components,  changes are broadcasted from the model via a DocumentEvent to  DocumentListeners. The DocumentEvent gives the location of the change and  the kind of change if desired. The code fragment might look something like:   DocumentListener myListener = ??; JTextArea myArea = ??; myArea.getDocument().addDocumentListener(myListener);   Newlines     For a discussion on how newlines are handled, see DefaultEditorKit.  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more information see Swing's  Threading Policy.  Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for  short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of  Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been  added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

A dynamic servant  (a DIR) is created by implementing the DynamicImplementation class, which  has a single invoke method. This method accepts a ServerRequest object. The  abstract class ServerRequest defines methods for accessing the method name,  the arguments and the context of the request, as well as methods for  setting the result of the request either as a return value or an exception.

For BufferedImages, the lookup operates on color and alpha components. The  number of lookup arrays may be one, in which case the same array is applied  to all color (but not alpha) components. Otherwise, the number of lookup  arrays may equal the number of Source color components, in which case no  lookup of the alpha component (if present) is performed.

Use CodeDomLocalizationProvider instead. http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=14202#)] public class LocalizationExtenderProvider : IExtenderProvider, IDisposable Summary: Provides design-time support for localization features to a root designer. Remarks: LocalizationExtenderProvider can extend an IRootDesigner with a set of properties and methods that provide support for the .NET Framework localization architecture. For more about using resources, see Localization. The localization support architecture enables designers to initialize component properties using resource files that can be swapped at run time to support a variety of languages, culture-specific styles and dynamically configurable features. You can use the methods of this class to enable designers and code generating serializers to load from resources and build initialization code that uses localization features. The default serializers that ship with Visual Studio are already capable of localizing components and controls, but they only do so if they locate support for the .NET Framework localization architecture. To detect the presence of localization support, the serialization system must locate a public Boolean property named #Localizable# on the root designer component. If a serializer finds this property, it searches for a property of type CultureInfo named #Language# to determine the current resource configuration. Default serializers use these properties to determine if it should localize any localizable resources of the component, and if so, what CultureInfo format the resource information should be saved in. Example: The following code example adds a LocalizationExtenderProvider to a component.  The following code example includes an example component and designer. The designer uses a LocalizationExtenderProvider to add localization support properties for the component.   using System; using System.Collections; using System.ComponentModel; using System.ComponentModel.Design; using System.Diagnostics; using System.Drawing; using System.Windows.Forms; using System.Windows.Forms.Design; // This example demonstrates adding localization support to a component hierarchy from a // custom IRootDesigner using the LocalizationExtenderProvider class. namespace LocalizationExtenderProviderExample { // RootViewDesignerComponent is a component associated with the SampleRootDesigner // IRootDesigner that provides LocalizationExtenderProvider localization support. // This derived class is included at the top of this example to enable // easy launching of designer view without having to put the class in its own file. public class RootViewDesignerComponent : RootDesignedComponent { public RootViewDesignerComponent() { } } // The following attribute associates the RootDesignedComponent with the RootDesignedComponent component.

The target name must abide by the following syntax:   CredentialClass {PrincipalClass PrincipalName}*   For example, the following permission grants access to the  com.sun.PrivateCredential owned by Subjects which have a com.sun.Principal  with the name, duke. Note that although this example, as well as all the  examples below, do not contain Codebase, SignedBy, or Principal information  in the grant statement (for simplicity reasons), actual policy  configurations should specify that information when appropriate.    grant { permission javax.security.auth.PrivateCredentialPermission com.sun.PrivateCredential com.sun.Principal  duke , read; };   If CredentialClass is *, then access is granted to all private  Credentials belonging to the specified Subject. If PrincipalName is *,  then access is granted to the specified Credential owned by any Subject  that has the specified Principal (the actual PrincipalName doesn't matter).

The API provides methods to access those objects such  that the attributes on the Adjustable object (such as unitIncrement, value,  etc.) can be manipulated.  Certain adjustable properties (minimum, maximum, blockIncrement, and  visibleAmount) are set internally by the scrollpane in accordance with the  geometry of the scrollpane and its child and these should not be set by  programs using the scrollpane.  If the scrollbar display policy is defined as never, then the scrollpane  can still be programmatically scrolled using the setScrollPosition() method  and the scrollpane will move and clip the child's contents appropriately.  This policy is useful if the program needs to create and manage its own  adjustable controls.  The placement of the scrollbars is controlled by platform-specific  properties set by the user outside of the program.  The initial size of this container is set to 100x100, but can be reset  using setSize().  Scrolling with the wheel on a wheel-equipped mouse is enabled by default.  This can be disabled using setWheelScrollingEnabled. Wheel scrolling can be  customized by setting the block and unit increment of the horizontal and  vertical Adjustables. For information on how mouse wheel events are  dispatched, see the class description for MouseWheelEvent.  Insets are used to define any space used by scrollbars and any borders  created by the scroll pane. getInsets() can be used to get the current  value for the insets.

Remarks: The ContextMenu class represents shortcut menus that can be displayed when the user clicks the right mouse button over a control or area of the form. Shortcut menus are typically used to combine different menu items from a MainMenu of a form that are useful for the user given the context of the application. For example, you can use a shortcut menu assigned to a TextBox control to provide menu items for changing the font of the text, finding text within the control, or Clipboard features for copying and pasting text. You can also display new MenuItem objects in a shortcut menu that are not located within a MainMenu to provide situation specific commands that are not appropriate for the MainMenu to display. Typically, a shortcut menu is displayed when a user clicks the right mouse button over a control or the form itself. Visible controls and Form have a ContextMenu property that binds the ContextMenu class to the control that displays the shortcut menu. More than one control can use a ContextMenu. You can use the SourceControl property to determine which control last displayed the shortcut menu in order to perform tasks specific to the control or to modify the shortcut menu displayed for the control. You might want to know when the shortcut menu is being displayed in order to set check marks, disable items, and perform other menu tasks before the menu is displayed to the user. You can handle the Popup event to determine when the shortcut menu is being displayed. Note In order to reuse MenuItem objects that are displayed in a MainMenu for use in a ContextMenu, you must create a copy of the menu using the CloneMenu method of the MenuItem class. You can also merge menu items and their submenu items into a single MenuItem object using the MergeMenu method of the MenuItem class. Example: The following code example creates an event handler for the Popup event of the ContextMenu. The code in the event handler determines which of two controls a PictureBox named pictureBox1 and a TextBox named textBox1 is the control displaying the shortcut menu. Depending on which control caused the ContextMenu to display its shortcut menu, the control adds the appropriate MenuItem objects to the ContextMenu. This example requires that you have an instance of the ContextMenu class, named contextMenu1, defined within the form. This example also requires that you have a TextBox and PictureBox added to a form and that the ContextMenu property of these controls is set to contextMenu1.

286,32698,449993,453737,8,"public interface SortedMap<K,V>   ","A Map that further provides a total ordering on its keys. The map is  ordered according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator  typically provided at sorted map creation time. This order is reflected  when iterating over the sorted map's collection views (returned by the  entrySet, keySet and values methods). Several additional operations are  provided to take advantage of the ordering. (This interface is the map  analogue of SortedSet.)  All keys inserted into a sorted map must implement the Comparable  interface (or be accepted by the specified comparator). Furthermore, all  such keys must be mutually comparable: k1.compareTo(k2) (or  comparator.compare(k1, k2)) must not throw a ClassCastException for any  keys k1 and k2 in the sorted map. Attempts to violate this restriction will  cause the offending method or constructor invocation to throw a  ClassCastException.  Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map (whether or not an  explicit comparator is provided) must be consistent with equals if the  sorted map is to correctly implement the Map interface. (See the  Comparable interface or Comparator interface for a precise definition of  consistent with equals.) This is so because the Map interface is defined in  terms of the equals operation, but a sorted map performs all key  comparisons using its compareTo (or compare) method, so two keys that are  deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted map,  equal. The behavior of a tree map is well-defined even if its ordering is  inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general contract of the  Map interface.  All general-purpose sorted map implementation classes should provide four  standard constructors: 1) A void (no arguments) constructor, which  creates an empty sorted map sorted according to the natural ordering of its  keys. 2) A constructor with a single argument of type Comparator, which  creates an empty sorted map sorted according to the specified comparator.  3) A constructor with a single argument of type Map, which creates a new  map with the same key-value mappings as its argument, sorted according to  the keys' natural ordering. 4) A constructor with a single argument of type  SortedMap, which creates a new sorted map with the same key-value mappings  and the same ordering as the input sorted map. There is no way to enforce  this recommendation, as interfaces cannot contain constructors.  Note: several methods return submaps with restricted key ranges. Such  ranges are half-open, that is, they include their low endpoint but not  their high endpoint (where applicable). If you need a closed range (which  includes both endpoints), and the key type allows for calculation of the  successor of a given key, merely request the subrange from lowEndpoint to  successor(highEndpoint). For example, suppose that m is a map whose keys  are strings. The following idiom obtains a view containing all of the  key-value mappings in m whose keys are between low and high, inclusive:   SortedMap<String, V> sub = m.subMap(low, high+ 0);  A similar technique can be used to generate an open range (which contains  neither endpoint). The following idiom obtains a view containing all of the  key-value mappings in m whose keys are between low and high, exclusive:   SortedMap<String, V> sub = m.subMap(low+ 0, high);  This interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework.

311,32620,447584,451328,8,public interface ResultSet   ,"A table of data representing a database result set, which is usually  generated by executing a statement that queries the database.  A ResultSet object maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data.  Initially the cursor is positioned before the first row. The next method  moves the cursor to the next row, and because it returns false when there  are no more rows in the ResultSet object, it can be used in a while loop to  iterate through the result set.  A default ResultSet object is not updatable and has a cursor that moves  forward only. Thus, you can iterate through it only once and only from the  first row to the last row. It is possible to produce ResultSet objects that  are scrollable and/or updatable. The following code fragment, in which con  is a valid Connection object, illustrates how to make a result set that is  scrollable and insensitive to updates by others, and that is updatable. See  ResultSet fields for other options.    Statement stmt = con.createStatement( ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE); ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(SELECT a, b FROM TABLE2); // rs will be scrollable, will not show changes made by others, // and will be updatable    The ResultSet interface provides getter methods (getBoolean, getLong, and  so on) for retrieving column values from the current row. Values can be  retrieved using either the index number of the column or the name of the  column. In general, using the column index will be more efficient. Columns  are numbered from 1. For maximum portability, result set columns within  each row should be read in left-to-right order, and each column should be  read only once.  For the getter methods, a JDBC driver attempts to convert the underlying  data to the Java type specified in the getter method and returns a suitable  Java value. The JDBC specification has a table showing the allowable  mappings from SQL types to Java types that can be used by the ResultSet  getter methods.  Column names used as input to getter methods are case insensitive. When a  getter method is called with a column name and several columns have the  same name, the value of the first matching column will be returned. The  column name option is designed to be used when column names are used in the  SQL query that generated the result set. For columns that are NOT  explicitly named in the query, it is best to use column numbers. If column  names are used, the programmer should take care to guarantee that they  uniquely refer to the intended columns, which can be assured with the SQL  AS clause.  A set of updater methods were added to this interface in the JDBC 2.0 API  (JavaTM 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.2). The comments regarding  parameters to the getter methods also apply to parameters to the updater  methods.  The updater methods may be used in two ways:     1. to update a column value in the current row. In a scrollable        ResultSet object, the cursor can be moved backwards and forwards, to       an absolute position, or to a position relative to the current row.       The following code fragment updates the NAME column in the fifth row       of the ResultSet object rs and then uses the method updateRow to       update the data source table from which rs was derived.          rs.absolute(5); // moves the cursor to the fifth row of rs rs.updateString(NAME, AINSWORTH); // updates the // NAME column of row 5 to be AINSWORTH rs.updateRow(); // updates the row in the data source       2. to insert column values into the insert row. An updatable ResultSet        object has a special row associated with it that serves as a staging       area for building a row to be inserted. The following code fragment       moves the cursor to the insert row, builds a three-column row, and       inserts it into rs and into the data source table using the method        insertRow.          rs.moveToInsertRow(); // moves cursor to the insert row rs.updateString(1, AINSWORTH); // updates the // first column of the insert row to be AINSWORTH rs.updateInt(2,35); // updates the second column to be 35 rs.updateBoolean(3, true); // updates the third column to true rs.insertRow(); rs.moveToCurrentRow();    A ResultSet object is automatically closed when the Statement object that  generated it is closed, re-executed, or used to retrieve the next result  from a sequence of multiple results.  The number, types and properties of a ResultSet object's columns are  provided by the ResulSetMetaData object returned by the  ResultSet.getMetaData method.

318,33168,485709,489453,8,public interface Destination ,"A Destination object encapsulates a provider-specific address. The JMS API  does not define a standard address syntax. Although a standard address  syntax was considered, it was decided that the differences in address  semantics between existing message-oriented middleware (MOM) products were  too wide to bridge with a single syntax.  Since Destination is an administered object, it may contain  provider-specific configuration information in addition to its address.  The JMS API also supports a client's use of provider-specific address  names.  Destination objects support concurrent use.  A Destination object is a JMS administered object.  JMS administered objects are objects containing configuration information  that are created by an administrator and later used by JMS clients. They  make it practical to administer the JMS API in the enterprise.  Although the interfaces for administered objects do not explicitly depend  on the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API, the JMS API  establishes the convention that JMS clients find administered objects by  looking them up in a JNDI namespace.  An administrator can place an administered object anywhere in a namespace.  The JMS API does not define a naming policy.  It is expected that JMS providers will provide the tools an administrator  needs to create and configure administered objects in a JNDI namespace. JMS  provider implementations of administered objects should implement the  javax.naming.Referenceable and java.io.Serializable interfaces so that they  can be stored in all JNDI naming contexts. In addition, it is recommended  that these implementations follow the JavaBeansTM design patterns.  This strategy provides several benefits:      * It hides provider-specific details from JMS clients.     * It abstracts JMS administrative information into objects in the Java       programming language (Java objects) that are easily organized and       administered from a common management console.     * Since there will be JNDI providers for all popular naming services,       JMS providers can deliver one implementation of administered objects       that will run everywhere.  An administered object should not hold on to any remote resources. Its  lookup should not use remote resources other than those used by the JNDI  API itself.  Clients should think of administered objects as local Java objects. Looking  them up should not have any hidden side effects or use surprising amounts  of local resources.

Return Value Type: System.Linq.IQueryable(Of TSource) An IQueryable(Of T) that contains default(TSource) if source is empty; otherwise, source. Usage Note In Visual Basic and C\#, you can call this method as an instance method on any object of type IQueryable(Of TSource). When you use instance method syntax to call this method, omit the first parameter. For more information, see Extension Methods (Visual Basic) or Extension Methods (C\# Programming Guide). Summary: Returns the elements of the specified sequence or the type parameter's default value in a singleton collection if the sequence is empty. Remarks: The DefaultIfEmpty(Of TSource)(IQueryable(Of TSource)) method generates a MethodCallExpression that represents calling DefaultIfEmpty(Of TSource)(IQueryable(Of TSource)) itself as a constructed generic method.

The query behavior that occurs as a result of executing an expression tree that represents calling DefaultIfEmpty(Of TSource)(IQueryable(Of TSource)) depends on the implementation of the type of the source parameter. The expected behavior is that it returns source if it is not empty. Otherwise, it returns an IQueryable(Of T) that contains default(TSource).

Example: The following code example demonstrates the creation of an accessibility-aware chart control, using the AccessibleObject and Control.ControlAccessibleObject classes to expose accessible information. The control plots two curves along with a legend. The ChartControlAccessibleObject class, which derives from ControlAccessibleObject, is used in the CreateAccessibilityInstance method to provide custom accessible information for the chart control. Since the chart legend is not an actual Control -based control, but instead is drawn by the chart control, it does not any built-in accessible information. Because of this, the ChartControlAccessibleObject class overrides the GetChild method to return the CurveLegendAccessibleObject that represents accessible information for each part of the legend.

332,34513,476363,480107,8,public abstract class ORB   ,"A class providing APIs for the CORBA Object Request Broker features. The  ORB class also provides pluggable ORB implementation APIs that allow  another vendor's ORB implementation to be used.  An ORB makes it possible for CORBA objects to communicate with each other  by connecting objects making requests (clients) with objects servicing  requests (servers).  The ORB class, which encapsulates generic CORBA functionality, does the  following: (Note that items 5 and 6, which include most of the methods in  the class ORB, are typically used with the Dynamic Invocation Interface  (DII) and the Dynamic Skeleton Interface (DSI). These interfaces may be  used by a developer directly, but most commonly they are used by the ORB  internally and are not seen by the general programmer.)     1. initializes the ORB implementation by supplying values for predefined       properties and environmental parameters    2. obtains initial object references to services such as the NameService       using the method resolve_initial_references    3. converts object references to strings and back    4. connects the ORB to a servant (an instance of a CORBA object       implementation) and disconnects the ORB from a servant    5. creates objects such as           o TypeCode           o Any           o NamedValue           o Context           o Environment           o lists (such as NVList) containing these objects    6. sends multiple messages in the DII  The ORB class can be used to obtain references to objects implemented  anywhere on the network.  An application or applet gains access to the CORBA environment by  initializing itself into an ORB using one of three init methods. Two of the  three methods use the properties (associations of a name with a value)  shown in the table below.  Property Name 	Property Value Standard Java CORBA Properties: org.omg.CORBA.ORBClass 	class name of an ORB implementation org.omg.CORBA.ORBSingletonClass 	class name of the ORB returned by init()  These properties allow a different vendor's ORB implementation to be  plugged in.  When an ORB instance is being created, the class name of the ORB  implementation is located using the following standard search order:     1. check in Applet parameter or application string array, if any    2. check in properties parameter, if any    3. check in the System properties    4. check in the orb.properties file located in the user.home directory       (if any)    5. check in the orb.properties file located in the java.home/lib       directory (if any)    6. fall back on a hardcoded default behavior (use the Java IDL       implementation)  Note that Java IDL provides a default implementation for the  fully-functional ORB and for the Singleton ORB. When the method init is  given no parameters, the default Singleton ORB is returned. When the method  init is given parameters but no ORB class is specified, the Java IDL ORB  implementation is returned.  The following code fragment creates an ORB object initialized with the  default ORB Singleton. This ORB has a restricted implementation to prevent  malicious applets from doing anything beyond creating typecodes. It is  called a singleton because there is only one instance for an entire virtual  machine.   ORB orb = ORB.init();   The following code fragment creates an ORB object for an application. The  parameter args represents the arguments supplied to the application's main  method. Since the property specifies the ORB class to be  SomeORBImplementation, the new ORB will be initialized with that ORB  implementation. If p had been null, and the arguments had not specified an  ORB class, the new ORB would have been initialized with the default Java  IDL implementation.   Properties p = new Properties(); p.put(org.omg.CORBA.ORBClass, SomeORBImplementation); ORB orb = ORB.init(args, p);   The following code fragment creates an ORB object for the applet supplied  as the first parameter. If the given applet does not specify an ORB class,  the new ORB will be initialized with the default Java IDL implementation.   ORB orb = ORB.init(myApplet, null);   An application or applet can be initialized in one or more ORBs. ORB  initialization is a bootstrap call into the CORBA world.

Remarks: The WriteXml method provides a way to write either data only, or both data and schema from a DataTable into an XML document, whereas the WriteXmlSchema method writes only the schema. To write both data and schema, use one of the overloads that include the XmlWriteMode parameter, and set its value to WriteSchema. Note that the same is true for the ReadXml and ReadXmlSchema methods, respectively. To read XML data, or both schema and data into the DataTable, use the ReadXml method. To read just the schema, use the ReadXmlSchema method. Note An InvalidOperationException will be thrown if a column type in the DataRow being read from or written to implements IDynamicMetaObjectProvider and does not implement IXmlSerializable. Example: The following console application creates two DataTable instances, adds each to a DataSet, creates a DataRelation relating the two tables, and then uses the WriteXml method to write the data contained within the parent table to a TextWriter. The example demonstrates the behavior when setting the writeHierarchy parameter to each of its values. Note This example shows how to use one of the overloaded versions of WriteXml.

Remarks: When smart labels are enabled, the chart repositions overlapping data point labels, based on a set of user-defined rules. Callout lines will be drawn to link the label with its data point. The visual attributes of the callout line can be controlled. These visual attributes include color, line style, and line width. The CalloutStyle and CalloutLineAnchorCapStyle properties control the embellishments, such as arrowheads, that appear at the end of the callout line. The CalloutLineColor property can be set to any Color object. If you set the color of the callout line, you will also automatically set the color of the CalloutLineAnchorCapStyle and the embellishment defined by the CalloutStyle. The CalloutLineWidth property controls the pixel width of the callout line. Use of this property will also scale the embellishments of the CalloutLineAnchorCapStyle and the CalloutStyle. The movement of smart labels can be controlled through the use of several motion-related properties. These define the rules of movement for the direction, distance and whether the data point label is allowed to leave the plotting area. The default movement rules will normally resolve most issues. The MaxMovingDistance defines a value that specifies the maximum distance in pixels from the data point that data point labels are allowed to be moved in case of overlapping. The MinMovingDistance property defines a value that specifies the minimum distance in pixels from the data point that data point labels will be moved in case of overlapping. When a data point label needs to be repositioned, the label will be moved by at least the number of pixels specified. The IsOverlappedHidden property indicates whether the labels are hidden when overlapping issues cannot be resolved. If the IsOverlappedHidden property is true, and the data point cannot be drawn within the area specified by MinMovingDistance and MaxMovingDistance in the directions allowed by MovingDirection, the data point label will not be drawn. The MovingDirection property defines the direction(s) in which the data point label can be moved. This property accepts one LabelAlignmentStyles value or a bitwise-OR of multiple LabelAlignmentStyles values. The default is the bitwise-OR of all LabelAlignmentStyles values, to allow repositioning in all possible directions except to the center of the data point. Smart labels are not supported for the following chart types: Bar charts: bar and hundred-percent-stacked bar charts. Shape charts: pie, doughnut, polar and radar charts.

It typically annotates a  multi-valued JavaBean property, but it can occur on single value JavaBean  property. During unmarshalling, each xml element that does not match a  static @XmlElement or @XmlElementRef annotation for the other JavaBean  properties on the class, is added to this catch-all property.

There can be only one XmlAnyElement annotated JavaBean property in a class  and its super classes.   Relationship to other annotations  This annotation can be used with XmlJavaTypeAdapter, so that users can map  their own data structure to DOM, which in turn can be composed into XML.  This annotation can be used with XmlMixed like this:   // List of java.lang.String or DOM nodes. @XmlAnyElement @XmlMixed List<Object> others;    Schema To Java example  The following schema would produce the following Java class:             class Foo { int a; int b; @XmlAnyElement List<Element> any; }   It can unmarshal instances like    1   // this will be bound to DOM, because unmarshalling is orderless 3  5     // this will be bound to DOM, because the annotation doesn't remember namespaces.    The following schema would produce the following Java class:               class Bar extends Foo { int c; // Foo.getAny() also represents wildcard content for type definition bar. }   It can unmarshal instances like    1   // this will be bound to DOM, because unmarshalling is orderless 3  5     // this now goes to Bar.c   // this will go to Foo.any     Using XmlAnyElement with XmlElementRef  The XmlAnyElement annotation can be used with XmlElementRefs to designate  additional elements that can participate in the content tree.  The following schema would produce the following Java class:             class Foo { @XmlAnyElement(lax=true) @XmlElementRefs({ @XmlElementRef(name=a, type=JAXBElement.class) @XmlElementRef(name=b, type=JAXBElement.class) }) List<Object> others; }  @XmlRegistry class ObjectFactory { ... @XmlElementDecl(name = a, namespace = , scope = Foo.class) JAXBElement<Integer> createFooA( Integer i ) { ... }  @XmlElementDecl(name = b, namespace = , scope = Foo.class) JAXBElement<Integer> createFooB( Integer i ) { ... }   It can unmarshal instances like    1     // this will unmarshal to a JAXBElement instance whose value is 1.   // this will unmarshal to a DOM Element. 3     // this will unmarshal to a JAXBElement instance whose value is 1.     W3C XML Schema lax wildcard emulation  The lax element of the annotation enables the emulation of the lax  wildcard semantics. For example, when the Java source code is annotated  like this:   @XmlRootElement class Foo { @XmlAnyElement(lax=true) public Object[] others; }   then the following document will unmarshal like this:        Foo foo = unmarshal(); // 1 for 'unknown', another for 'foo' assert foo.others.length==2; // 'unknown' unmarshals to a DOM element assert foo.others[0] instanceof Element; // because of lax=true, the 'foo' element eagerly // unmarshals to a Foo object. assert foo.others[1] instanceof Foo;   Since:     JAXB2.0  Optional Element Summary  boolean 	lax           Controls the unmarshaller behavior when it sees elements known to  the current JAXBContext.

When false      If false, all the elements that match the property will be unmarshalled     to DOM, and the property will only contain DOM elements.       When true      If true, when an element matches a property marked with XmlAnyElement      is known to JAXBContext (for example, there's a class with      XmlRootElement that has the same tag name, or there's XmlElementDecl      that has the same tag name), the unmarshaller will eagerly unmarshal     this element to the JAXB object, instead of unmarshalling it to DOM.     Additionally, if the element is unknown but it has a known xsi:type,     the unmarshaller eagerly unmarshals the element to a JAXBElement, with     the unknown element name and the JAXBElement value is set to an     instance of the JAXB mapping of the known xsi:type.      As a result, after the unmarshalling, the property can become     heterogeneous; it can have both DOM nodes and some JAXB objects at the     same time.

407,33160,485679,489423,8,public interface Connection ,"A Connection object is a client's active connection to its JMS provider. It  typically allocates provider resources outside the Java virtual machine  (JVM).  Connections support concurrent use.  A connection serves several purposes:      * It encapsulates an open connection with a JMS provider. It typically       represents an open TCP/IP socket between a client and the service       provider software.     * Its creation is where client authentication takes place.     * It can specify a unique client identifier.     * It provides a ConnectionMetaData object.     * It supports an optional ExceptionListener object.  Because the creation of a connection involves setting up authentication and  communication, a connection is a relatively heavyweight object. Most  clients will do all their messaging with a single connection. Other more  advanced applications may use several connections. The JMS API does not  architect a reason for using multiple connections; however, there may be  operational reasons for doing so.  A JMS client typically creates a connection, one or more sessions, and a  number of message producers and consumers. When a connection is created, it  is in stopped mode. That means that no messages are being delivered.  It is typical to leave the connection in stopped mode until setup is  complete (that is, until all message consumers have been created). At that  point, the client calls the connection's start method, and messages begin  arriving at the connection's consumers. This setup convention minimizes any  client confusion that may result from asynchronous message delivery while  the client is still in the process of setting itself up.  A connection can be started immediately, and the setup can be done  afterwards. Clients that do this must be prepared to handle asynchronous  message delivery while they are still in the process of setting up.  A message producer can send messages while a connection is stopped.

414,32077,435685,439429,8,public final class LinearGradientPaint   ,"The LinearGradientPaint class provides a way to fill a Shape with a linear  color gradient pattern. The user may specify two or more gradient colors,  and this paint will provide an interpolation between each color. The user  also specifies start and end points which define where in user space the  color gradient should begin and end.  The user must provide an array of floats specifying how to distribute the  colors along the gradient. These values should range from 0.0 to 1.0 and  act like keyframes along the gradient (they mark where the gradient should  be exactly a particular color).  In the event that the user does not set the first keyframe value equal to 0  and/or the last keyframe value equal to 1, keyframes will be created at  these positions and the first and last colors will be replicated there. So,  if a user specifies the following arrays to construct a gradient:   {Color.BLUE, Color.RED}, {.3f, .7f}   this will be converted to a gradient with the following keyframes:   {Color.BLUE, Color.BLUE, Color.RED, Color.RED}, {0f, .3f, .7f, 1f}   The user may also select what action the LinearGradientPaint should take  when filling color outside the start and end points. If no cycle method is  specified, NO_CYCLE will be chosen by default, which means the endpoint  colors will be used to fill the remaining area.  The colorSpace parameter allows the user to specify in which colorspace the  interpolation should be performed, default sRGB or linearized RGB.  The following code demonstrates typical usage of LinearGradientPaint:   Point2D start = new Point2D.Float(0, 0); Point2D end = new Point2D.Float(50, 50); float[] dist = {0.0f, 0.2f, 1.0f}; Color[] colors = {Color.RED, Color.WHITE, Color.BLUE}; LinearGradientPaint p = new LinearGradientPaint(start, end, dist, colors);   This code will create a LinearGradientPaint which interpolates between red  and white for the first 20% of the gradient and between white and blue for  the remaining 80%.

The timer MBean sends out  an alarm at a specified time that wakes up all the listeners registered to  receive timer notifications.  This class manages a list of dated timer notifications. A method allows  users to add/remove as many notifications as required. When a timer  notification is emitted by the timer and becomes obsolete, it is  automatically removed from the list of timer notifications. Additional timer notifications can be added into regularly repeating  notifications.  Note:     1. When sending timer notifications, the timer updates the notification       sequence number irrespective of the notification type.    2. The timer service relies on the system date of the host where the        Timer class is loaded. Listeners may receive untimely notifications       if their host has a different system date. To avoid such problems,       synchronize the system date of all host machines where timing is       needed.    3. The default behavior for periodic notifications is fixed-delay       execution, as specified in Timer. In order to use fixed-rate       execution, use the overloaded addNotification(String, String, Object,       Date, long, long, boolean) method.    4. Notification listeners are potentially all executed in the same       thread. Therefore, they should execute rapidly to avoid holding up       other listeners or perturbing the regularity of fixed-delay       executions. See NotificationBroadcasterSupport.

Remarks: The ConstraintCollection is accessed through the DataTable.Constraints property. The ConstraintCollection can contain both UniqueConstraint and ForeignKeyConstraint objects for the DataTable. A UniqueConstraint object makes sure that data in a specific column is always unique to preserve the data integrity. The ForeignKeyConstraint determines what will occur in related tables when data in the DataTable is either updated or deleted. For example, if a row is deleted, the ForeignKeyConstraint will determine whether the related rows are also deleted (a cascade), or some other course of action. Note When you add a DataRelation that creates a relationship between two tables to a DataSet, both a ForeignKeyConstraint and a UniqueConstraint are created automatically. The UniqueConstraint is applied to the primary key column in the parent DataTable, and the constraint is added to that table's ConstraintCollection. The ForeignKeyConstraint is applied to the primary key column and the foreign key column, and the constraint is added to the child table's ConstraintCollection. The ConstraintCollection uses standard collection methods such as Add, Clear, and Remove. In addition, the Contains method can be used to look for the existence of a particular constraint in the collection. A UniqueConstraint is created when a DataColumn with its Unique property set to true is added to a DataTable object's DataColumnCollection. A ForeignKeyConstraint is created when a DataRelation is added to a DataSet object's DataRelationCollection. Example: The first example creates a DataTable, and adds a DataColumn (with its Unique property set to true) to the DataColumnCollection. The second example creates a DataSet, two DataTable objects, four columns, and a DataRelation. The count of constraints is then printed to show that a ForeignKeyConstraint and a UniqueConstraint are created when a DataRelation is added to the DataSet object's DataRelationCollection.

472,40396,234647,237631,7,System.Numerics.Complex,"Additional online Documentation: Syntax: [SerializableAttribute] public struct Complex : IEquatable<Complex>, IFormattable Summary: Represents a complex number. Remarks: A complex number is a number that comprises a real number part and an imaginary number part. A complex number z is usually written in the form z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit that has the property i2 = -1. The real part of the complex number is represented by x, and the imaginary part of the complex number is represented by y. The Complex type uses the Cartesian coordinate system (real, imaginary) when instantiating and manipulating complex numbers. A complex number can be represented as a point in a two-dimensional coordinate system, which is known as the complex plane. The real part of the complex number is positioned on the x-axis (the horizontal axis), and the imaginary part is positioned on the y-axis (the vertical axis). Any point in the complex plane can also be expressed based on its absolute value, by using the polar coordinate system., In polar coordinates, a point is characterized by two numbers: Its magnitude, which is the distance of the point from the origin (that is, 0,0, or the point at which the x-axis and the y-axis intersect). Its phase, which is the angle between the real axis and the line drawn from the origin to the point. Instantiating a Complex Number You can assign a value to a complex number in one of the following ways: By passing two Double values to its constructor. The first value represents the real part of the complex number, and the second value represents its imaginary part. These values represent the position of the complex number in the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. By calling the static (Shared in Visual Basic) Complex.FromPolarCoordinates method to create a complex number from its polar coordinates. By assigning a Byte, SByte, Int16, UInt16, Int32, UInt32, Int64, UInt64, Single, or Double value to a Complex object. The value becomes the real part of the complex number, and its imaginary part equals 0. By casting (in ) or converting (in Visual Basic) a Decimal or BigInteger value to a Complex object. The value becomes the real part of the complex number, and its imaginary part equals 0. By assigning the complex number that is returned by a method or operator to a Complex object. For example, Complex.Add is a static method that returns a complex number that is the sum of two complex numbers, and the Complex.Addition operator adds two complex numbers and returns the result. The following example demonstrates each of these five ways of assigning a value to a complex number.  Operations with Complex Numbers The Complex structure in the .NET Framework includes members that provide the following functionality: Methods to compare two complex numbers to determine whether they are equal. Operators to perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers. Complex operators enable you to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and unary negation with complex numbers. Methods to perform other numerical operations on complex numbers. In addition to the four basic arithmetic operations, you can raise a complex number to a specified power, find the square root of a complex number, and get the absolute value of a complex number. Methods to perform trigonometric operations on complex numbers. For example, you can calculate the tangent of an angle represented by a complex number. Precision and Complex Numbers The real and imaginary parts of a complex number are represented by two double-precision floating-point values. This means that Complex values, like double-precision floating-point values, can lose precision as a result of numerical operations. This means that strict comparisons for equality of two Complex values may fail, even if the difference between the two values is due to a loss of precision. For more information, see Double. For example, performing exponentiation on the logarithm of a number should return the original number. However, in some cases, the loss of precision of floating-point values can cause slight differences between the two values, as the following example illustrates.    Similarly, the following example, which calculates the square root of a Complex number, produces slightly different results on the 32-bit and IA64 versions of the .NET Framework.    Complex Numbers, Infinity, and NaN The real and imaginary parts of a complex number are represented by Double values. In addition to ranging from Double.MinValue to Double.MaxValue, the real or imaginary part of a complex number can have a value of Double.PositiveInfinity, Double.NegativeInfinity, or Double.NaN. Double.PositiveInfinity, Double.NegativeInfinity, and Double.NaN all propagate in any arithmetic or trigonometric operation. In the following example, division by Zero produces a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are both Double.NaN. As a result, performing multiplication with this value also produces a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are Double.NaN. Similarly, performing a multiplication that overflows the range of the Double type produces a complex number whose real part is Double.NaN and whose imaginary part is Double.PositiveInfinity. Subsequently performing division with this complex number returns a complex number whose real part is Double.NaN and whose imaginary part is Double.PositiveInfinity.    Mathematical operations with complex numbers that are invalid or that overflow the range of the Double data type do not throw an exception. Instead, they return a Double.PositiveInfinity, Double.NegativeInfinity, or Double.NaN under the following conditions: The division of a positive number by zero returns Double.PositiveInfinity. Any operation that overflows the upper bound of the Double data type returns Double.PositiveInfinity. The division of a negative number by zero returns Double.NegativeInfinity. Any operation that overflows the lower bound of the Double data type returns Double.NegativeInfinity. The division of a zero by zero returns Double.NaN. Any operation that is performed on operands whose values are Double.PositiveInfinity, Double.NegativeInfinity, or Double.NaN returns Double.PositiveInfinity, Double.NegativeInfinity, or Double.NaN, depending on the specific operation. Note that this applies to any intermediate calculations performed by a method. For example, the multiplication of new Complex(9e308, 9e308) and new Complex(2.5, 3.5) uses the formula (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i. The calculation of the real component that results from the multiplication evaluates the expression 9e308 * 2.5 - 9e308 * 3.5. Each intermediate multiplication in this expression returns Double.PositiveInfinity, and the attempt to subtract Double.PositiveInfinity from Double.PositiveInfinity returns Double.NaN. Formatting a Complex Number By default, the string representation of a complex number takes the form (real, imaginary), where real and imaginary are the string representations of the Double values that form the complex number's real and imaginary components. Some overloads of the ToString method allow customization of the string representations of these Double values to reflect the formatting conventions of a particular culture or to appear in a particular format defined by a standard or custom numeric format string. (For more information, see Standard Numeric Format Strings and Custom Numeric Format Strings.) One of the more common ways of expressing the string representation of a complex number takes the form a + bi, where a is the complex number's real component, and b is the complex number's imaginary component. In electrical engineering, a complex number is most commonly expressed as a + bj. You can return the string representation of a complex number in either of these two forms. To do this, define a custom format provider by implementing the ICustomFormatter and IFormatProvider interfaces, and then call the String.Format(IFormatProvider, String, Object()) method. The following example defines a ComplexFormatter class that represents a complex number as a string in the form of either a + bi or a + bj.    The following example then uses this custom formatter to display the string representation of a complex number.

Remarks: The X509IssuerSerial structure represents the <X509IssuerSerial> element of an XML digital signature defined by the XML digital signature specification. The <X509IssuerSerial> element is the subelement of the <X509Data> element that contains an X.509v3 certificate issuer's distinguished name and serial number pair. The distinguished name and serial number pair help identify a specific X.509v3 certificate. The issuer of an X.509 certificate is the name of the certification authority that issued the certificate. Certification authorities assign each certificate they issue a unique serial number for identification purposes. Use the X509IssuerSerial structure to specify a certificate issuer's distinguished name and serial number pair when using the KeyInfoX509Data class. You can add an X509IssuerSerial structure to the KeyInfoX509Data class using the IssuerSerials property. Alternatively, you can add string values that represent the X.509 certificate issuer's distinguished name and serial number pair using the AddIssuerSerial method. For more information about the <X509IssuerSerial> element, see the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specification at www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/.

500,32662,448348,452092,8,public abstract class DateFormat   ,"DateFormat is an abstract class for date/time formatting subclasses which  formats and parses dates or time in a language-independent manner. The  date/time formatting subclass, such as SimpleDateFormat, allows for  formatting (i.e., date -> text), parsing (text -> date), and normalization.  The date is represented as a Date object or as the milliseconds since  January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.  DateFormat provides many class methods for obtaining default date/time  formatters based on the default or a given locale and a number of  formatting styles. The formatting styles include FULL, LONG, MEDIUM, and  SHORT. More detail and examples of using these styles are provided in the  method descriptions.  DateFormat helps you to format and parse dates for any locale. Your code  can be completely independent of the locale conventions for months, days of  the week, or even the calendar format: lunar vs. solar.  To format a date for the current Locale, use one of the static factory  methods:   myString = DateFormat.getDateInstance().format(myDate);   If you are formatting multiple dates, it is more efficient to get the  format and use it multiple times so that the system doesn't have to fetch  the information about the local language and country conventions multiple  times.   DateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateInstance(); for (int i = 0; i < myDate.length; ++i) { output.println(df.format(myDate[i]) + ; ); }   To format a date for a different Locale, specify it in the call to  getDateInstance().   DateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.LONG, Locale.FRANCE);   You can use a DateFormat to parse also.   myDate = df.parse(myString);   Use getDateInstance to get the normal date format for that country. There  are other static factory methods available. Use getTimeInstance to get the  time format for that country. Use getDateTimeInstance to get a date and  time format. You can pass in different options to these factory methods to  control the length of the result; from SHORT to MEDIUM to LONG to FULL. The  exact result depends on the locale, but generally:      * SHORT is completely numeric, such as 12.13.52 or 3:30pm     * MEDIUM is longer, such as Jan 12, 1952     * LONG is longer, such as January 12, 1952 or 3:30:32pm     * FULL is pretty completely specified, such as Tuesday, April 12, 1952       AD or 3:30:42pm PST.  You can also set the time zone on the format if you wish. If you want even  more control over the format or parsing, (or want to give your users more  control), you can try casting the DateFormat you get from the factory  methods to a SimpleDateFormat. This will work for the majority of  countries; just remember to put it in a try block in case you encounter an  unusual one.  You can also use forms of the parse and format methods with ParsePosition  and FieldPosition to allow you to      * progressively parse through pieces of a string.     * align any particular field, or find out where it is for selection on       the screen.   Synchronization  Date formats are not synchronized. It is recommended to create separate  format instances for each thread. If multiple threads access a format  concurrently, it must be synchronized externally.

535,33484,458337,462081,8,public final class PageRanges   ,"Class PageRanges is a printing attribute class, a set of integers, that  identifies the range(s) of print-stream pages that the Printer object uses  for each copy of each document which are to be printed. Nothing is printed  for any pages identified that do not exist in the document(s). The  attribute is associated with print-stream pages, not application-numbered  pages (for example, the page numbers found in the headers and or footers  for certain word processing applications).  In most cases, the exact pages to be printed will be generated by a device  driver and this attribute would not be required. However, when printing an  archived document which has already been formatted, the end user may elect  to print just a subset of the pages contained in the document. In this  case, if a page range of n-m is specified, the first page to be printed  will be page n. All subsequent pages of the document will be printed  through and including page m.  If a PageRanges attribute is not specified for a print job, all pages of  the document will be printed. In other words, the default value for the  PageRanges attribute is always {{1, Integer.MAX_VALUE}}.  The effect of a PageRanges attribute on a multidoc print job (a job with  multiple documents) depends on whether all the docs have the same page  ranges specified or whether different docs have different page ranges  specified, and on the (perhaps defaulted) value of the  MultipleDocumentHandling attribute.      * If all the docs have the same page ranges specified, then any value       of MultipleDocumentHandling makes sense, and the printer's processing       depends on the MultipleDocumentHandling value:           o SINGLE_DOCUMENT -- All the input docs will be combined together             into one output document. The specified page ranges of that             output document will be printed.            o SINGLE_DOCUMENT_NEW_SHEET -- All the input docs will be             combined together into one output document, and the first             impression of each input doc will always start on a new media             sheet.

539,32774,451129,454873,8,public interface Condition ,"Condition factors out the Object monitor methods (wait, notify and  notifyAll) into distinct objects to give the effect of having multiple  wait-sets per object, by combining them with the use of arbitrary Lock  implementations. Where a Lock replaces the use of synchronized methods and  statements, a Condition replaces the use of the Object monitor methods.  Conditions (also known as condition queues or condition variables) provide  a means for one thread to suspend execution (to wait) until notified by  another thread that some state condition may now be true. Because access to  this shared state information occurs in different threads, it must be  protected, so a lock of some form is associated with the condition. The key  property that waiting for a condition provides is that it atomically  releases the associated lock and suspends the current thread, just like  Object.wait.  A Condition instance is intrinsically bound to a lock. To obtain a  Condition instance for a particular Lock instance use its newCondition()  method.  As an example, suppose we have a bounded buffer which supports put and  take methods. If a take is attempted on an empty buffer, then the thread  will block until an item becomes available; if a put is attempted on a full  buffer, then the thread will block until a space becomes available. We  would like to keep waiting put threads and take threads in separate  wait-sets so that we can use the optimization of only notifying a single  thread at a time when items or spaces become available in the buffer. This  can be achieved using two Condition instances.   class BoundedBuffer { final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock(); final Condition notFull  = lock.newCondition();  final Condition notEmpty = lock.newCondition();   final Object[] items = new Object[100]; int putptr, takeptr, count;  public void put(Object x) throws InterruptedException { lock.lock(); try { while (count == items.length) notFull.await(); items[putptr] = x; if (++putptr == items.length) putptr = 0; ++count; notEmpty.signal(); } finally { lock.unlock(); } }  public Object take() throws InterruptedException { lock.lock(); try { while (count == 0) notEmpty.await(); Object x = items[takeptr]; if (++takeptr == items.length) takeptr = 0; --count; notFull.signal(); return x; } finally { lock.unlock(); } } }   (The ArrayBlockingQueue class provides this functionality, so there is no  reason to implement this sample usage class.)  A Condition implementation can provide behavior and semantics that is  different from that of the Object monitor methods, such as guaranteed  ordering for notifications, or not requiring a lock to be held when  performing notifications. If an implementation provides such specialized  semantics then the implementation must document those semantics.  Note that Condition instances are just normal objects and can themselves be  used as the target in a synchronized statement, and can have their own  monitor wait and notification methods invoked. Acquiring the monitor lock  of a Condition instance, or using its monitor methods, has no specified  relationship with acquiring the Lock associated with that Condition or the  use of its waiting and signalling methods. It is recommended that to avoid  confusion you never use Condition instances in this way, except perhaps  within their own implementation.  Except where noted, passing a null value for any parameter will result in a  NullPointerException being thrown.   Implementation Considerations  When waiting upon a Condition, a spurious wakeup is permitted to occur,  in general, as a concession to the underlying platform semantics. This has  little practical impact on most application programs as a Condition should  always be waited upon in a loop, testing the state predicate that is being  waited for. An implementation is free to remove the possibility of spurious  wakeups but it is recommended that applications programmers always assume  that they can occur and so always wait in a loop.  The three forms of condition waiting (interruptible, non-interruptible, and  timed) may differ in their ease of implementation on some platforms and in  their performance characteristics. In particular, it may be difficult to  provide these features and maintain specific semantics such as ordering  guarantees. Further, the ability to interrupt the actual suspension of the  thread may not always be feasible to implement on all platforms.  Consequently, an implementation is not required to define exactly the same  guarantees or semantics for all three forms of waiting, nor is it required  to support interruption of the actual suspension of the thread.  An implementation is required to clearly document the semantics and  guarantees provided by each of the waiting methods, and when an  implementation does support interruption of thread suspension then it must  obey the interruption semantics as defined in this interface.  As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for interruption  are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding to an  interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be shown  that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked the  thread. An implementation should document this behavior.

The wsdlLocation is a URL (relative or absolute) that refers to a     pre-existing WSDL file.

Remarks: The WorkflowInstance class exposes methods and properties that can be used to control the execution of a workflow instance; it is essentially a proxy to the actual workflow instance used by the workflow runtime engine. A host or a service can instruct the workflow runtime engine to perform actions on a workflow instance by calling the appropriate methods that are contained in the WorkflowInstance class. If the requested action is not valid, for example, if the host calls Load on a workflow instance that has already completed, the workflow runtime engine will raise an appropriate exception. Note If a workflow instance becomes unresponsive because a call on the host application does not return, the only way to recover the instance is to restart the runtime. However, if the instance has been forcibly unloaded, aborted, or suspended, it can be continued by calling the WorkflowInstance.Resume method. Example: The following code example demonstrates how you can create and start a WorkflowInstance in a workflow host. The code creates an instance of the WorkflowRuntime, adds services to the runtime, and then demonstrates the recommended way to create a WorkflowInstance object. The code initializes WorkflowInstance by calling the CreateWorkflow method and passing the previously created type to it. The WorkflowInstance is started with the Start method call.

Implements IDynamicDataSource.Where Summary: Gets or sets a value that specifies what conditions must be true for a record to be included in the retrieved data. Remarks: You use the Where property to specify the conditions for the record to be returned from a query. The syntax for the Where property is the same as the syntax for a LINQ Where clause in . You specify an expression that results in a Boolean value, and if the expression evaluates to true for a given row, the row is included in the result set. Expressions are composed of column names, comparison operators, and values to compare to, as shown in the following example:  To specify multiple expressions linked by logical AND or OR operators, you use && as a logical AND operator and || as a logical OR operator, as shown in the following example:    If you want to test a property against a literal string value, the literal string value must be enclosed in double quotation marks. To do this in markup, enclose the Where clause value in single quotation marks, as shown in the following example:    To test against a literal string value in code, use escape characters that are appropriate to the language you are using in order to insert double quotation marks, as shown in the following example:    If you want to test whether a string is greater than or less than an string, you must use methods of the String class instead of using < or > operators between the column name and the string value. The following examples show how to select rows that have Category values that are less than, less than or equal to, greater than, or greater than or equal to #Sports#:    You can also use  methods of the String class, such as StartsWith, EndsWith, and Contains. For more information about how to compare strings, see Comparing Strings. For more information about Where clause syntax, see  Operators and where clause ( Reference). In addition to filtering based on static values that you define when you create the Web page, you can filter based on dynamic values that are evaluated at run time. In that case, you include a named parameter in the Where property that acts as a placeholder for the value. You then add a parameter that has the matching name to the WhereParameters collection. Alternatively, you can set the AutoGenerateWhereClause property to true and define the parameters in the WhereParameters collection. When the AutoGenerateWhereClause property is true, you do not have to include the named parameters in the Where property. Instead, the LinqDataSource control automatically generates the Where clause from the parameters in the WhereParameters property. For more information about how to filter data, see Walkthrough: Selecting and Filtering a Subset of Data with the LinqDataSource and GridView Controls. Example: The following example shows how to filter the data returned from a query based on a static condition.

Beans declared with scope @Dependent behave differently to beans with other  built-in scope types. When a bean is declared to have scope @Dependent:      * No injected instance of the bean is ever shared between multiple       injection points.     * Any instance of the bean injected into an object that is being       created by the container is bound to the lifecycle of the newly       created object.     * When a Unified EL expression in a JSF or JSP page that refers to the       bean by its EL name is evaluated, at most one instance of the bean is       instantiated. This instance exists to service just a single       evaluation of the EL expression. It is reused if the bean EL name       appears multiple times in the EL expression, but is never reused when       the EL expression is evaluated again, or when another EL expression       is evaluated.     * Any instance of the bean that receives a producer method, producer       field, disposer method or observer method invocation exists to       service that invocation only.     * Any instance of the bean injected into method parameters of a       disposer method or observer method exists to service the method       invocation only.  Every invocation of the Context.get(Contextual, CreationalContext)  operation of the context object for the @Dependent scope returns a new  instance of the given bean.  Every invocation of the Context.get(Contextual) operation of the context  object for the @Dependent scope returns a null value.  The @Dependent scope is always active.  Many instances of beans with scope @Dependent belong to some other bean or  Java EE component class instance and are called dependent objects.      * Instances of decorators and interceptors are dependent objects of the       bean instance they decorate.     * An instance of a bean with scope @Dependent injected into a field,       bean constructor or initializer method is a dependent object of the       bean or Java EE component class instance into which it was injected.     * An instance of a bean with scope @Dependent injected into a producer       method is a dependent object of the producer method bean instance       that is being produced.     * An instance of a bean with scope @Dependent obtained by direct       invocation of an Instance is a dependent object of the instance of        Instance.  When the container destroys an instance of a bean or of any Java EE  component class supporting injection, the container destroys all its  dependent objects, after the @PreDestroy callback completes and after the  servlet destroy() method is called.

That is, you can use either the type you specified or any type that is more derived. For more information about covariance and contravariance, see Covariance and Contravariance in Generics. Parameters arg1Type: T1 The first parameter of the method that this delegate encapsulates. arg2Type: T2 The second parameter of the method that this delegate encapsulates. arg3Type: T3 The third parameter of the method that this delegate encapsulates. arg4Type: T4 The fourth parameter of the method that this delegate encapsulates. arg5Type: T5 The fifth parameter of the method that this delegate encapsulates. arg6Type: T6 The sixth parameter of the method that this delegate encapsulates. arg7Type: T7 The seventh parameter of the method that this delegate encapsulates. arg8Type: T8 The eighth parameter of the method that this delegate encapsulates. arg9Type: T9 The ninth parameter of the method that this delegate encapsulates. arg10Type: T10 The tenth parameter of the method that this delegate encapsulates. Return Value Type: TResult The return value of the method that this delegate encapsulates. Summary: Encapsulates a method that has 10 parameters and returns a value of the type specified by the TResult parameter. Remarks: You can use this delegate to represent a method that can be passed as a parameter without explicitly declaring a custom delegate. The encapsulated method must correspond to the method signature that is defined by this delegate. This means that the encapsulated method must have 10 parameters, each of which is passed to it by value, and that it must return a value. Note To reference a method that has 10 parameters and returns void (or in Visual Basic, that is declared as a Sub rather than as a Function), use the generic Action(Of T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10) delegate instead. You can also use the Func(Of T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10, TResult) delegate with anonymous methods and lambda expressions. The underlying type of a lambda expression is one of the generic Func delegates. This makes it possible to pass a lambda expression as a parameter without explicitly assigning it to a delegate.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,4,615,mixed

601,38056,220640,223589,7,System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.ConnectionString,"Additional online Documentation: Syntax: [SettingsBindableAttribute(true)] public override string ConnectionString { get; set; } Property Value Type: System.String The connection string that includes the source database name, and other parameters needed to establish the initial connection. The default value is an empty string. Implements IDbConnection.ConnectionString Summary: Gets or sets the string used to open a SQL Server database. Remarks: The ConnectionString is similar to an OLE DB connection string, but is not identical. Unlike OLE DB or ADO, the connection string that is returned is the same as the user-set ConnectionString, minus security information if the Persist Security Info value is set to false (default). The .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server does not persist or return the password in a connection string unless you set Persist Security Info to true. You can use the ConnectionString property to connect to a database. The following example illustrates a typical connection string.  Use the new SqlConnectionStringBuilder to construct valid connection strings at run time. For more information, see Connection String Builders (ADO.NET). The ConnectionString property can be set only when the connection is closed. Many of the connection string values have corresponding read-only properties. When the connection string is set, these properties are updated, except when an error is detected. In this case, none of the properties are updated. SqlConnection properties return only those settings that are contained in the ConnectionString. To connect to a local computer, specify #(local)# for the server. If a server name is not specified, a connection will be attempted to the default instance on the local computer. Resetting the ConnectionString on a closed connection resets all connection string values (and related properties) including the password. For example, if you set a connection string that includes #Database= AdventureWorks#, and then reset the connection string to #Data Source=myserver;Integrated Security=true#, the Database property is no longer set to #AdventureWorks#. The connection string is parsed immediately after being set. If errors in syntax are found when parsing, a runtime exception, such as ArgumentException, is generated. Other errors can be found only when an attempt is made to open the connection. The basic format of a connection string includes a series of keyword/value pairs separated by semicolons. The equal sign (=) connects each keyword and its value. To include values that contain a semicolon, single-quote character, or double-quote character, the value must be enclosed in double quotation marks. If the value contains both a semicolon and a double-quote character, the value can be enclosed in single quotation marks. The single quotation mark is also useful if the value starts with a double-quote character. Conversely, the double quotation mark can be used if the value starts with a single quotation mark. If the value contains both single-quote and double-quote characters, the quotation mark character used to enclose the value must be doubled every time it occurs within the value. To include preceding or trailing spaces in the string value, the value must be enclosed in either single quotation marks or double quotation marks. Any leading or trailing spaces around integer, Boolean, or enumerated values are ignored, even if enclosed in quotation marks. However, spaces within a string literal keyword or value are preserved. Using .NET Framework version 1.1 or later, single or double quotation marks may be used within a connection string without using delimiters (for example, Data Source= my'Server or Data Source= my#Server), unless a quotation mark character is the first or last character in the value. Keywords are not case sensitive. The following table lists the valid names for keyword values within the ConnectionString. Keyword Default Description Addr N/A Synonym of Data Source. Address N/A Synonym of Data Source. App N/A Synonym of Application Name. Application Name N/A The name of the application, or '.NET SQLClient Data Provider' if no application name is provided. An application name can be 128 characters or less. Asynchronous Processing -or- Async 'false' When true, enables asynchronous operation support. Recognized values are true, false, yes, and no. AttachDBFilename -or- Extended Properties -or- Initial File Name N/A The name of the primary database file, including the full path name of an attachable database. AttachDBFilename is only supported for primary data files with an .mdf extension. If the value of the AttachDBFileName key is specified in the connection string, the database is attached and becomes the default database for the connection. If this key is not specified and if the database was previously attached, the database will not be reattached. The previously attached database will be used as the default database for the connection. If this key is specified together with the AttachDBFileName key, the value of this key will be used as the alias. However, if the name is already used in an attached database, the connection will fail. The path may be absolute or relative by using the DataDirectory substitution string. If DataDirectory is used, the database file must exist within a subdirectory of the directory pointed to by the substitution string. Note Remote server, HTTP, and UNC path names are not supported. The database name must be specified with the keyword 'database' (or one of its aliases) as in the following: #AttachDbFileName=|DataDirectory|\\data\\YourDB.mdf;integrated security=true;database=YourDatabase# An error will be generated if a log file exists in the same directory as the data file and the 'database' keyword is used when attaching the primary data file. In this case, remove the log file. Once the database is attached, a new log file will be automatically generated based on the physical path. Connection Lifetime -or- Load Balance Timeout 0 When a connection is returned to the pool, its creation time is compared with the current time, and the connection is destroyed if that time span (in seconds) exceeds the value specified by Connection Lifetime. This is useful in clustered configurations to force load balancing between a running server and a server just brought online. A value of zero (0) causes pooled connections to have the maximum connection timeout. Connect Timeout -or- Connection Timeout -or- Timeout 15 The length of time (in seconds) to wait for a connection to the server before terminating the attempt and generating an error. Valid values are greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 2147483647. Context Connection 'false' true if an in-process connection to SQL Server should be made. Current Language -or- Language N/A Sets the language used for database server warning or error messages. The language name can be 128 characters or less. Data Source -or- Server -or- Address -or- Addr -or- Network Address N/A The name or network address of the instance of SQL Server to which to connect. The port number can be specified after the server name: server=tcp:servername, portnumber When specifying a local instance, always use (local). To force a protocol, add one of the following prefixes: np:(local), tcp:(local), lpc:(local) Data Source must use the TCP format or the Named Pipes format. TCP format is as follows: tcp:<host name>\\<instance name> tcp:<host name>,<TCP/IP port number> The TCP format must start with the prefix #tcp:# and is followed by the database instance, as specified by a host name and an instance name. The host name MUST be specified in one of the following ways: NetBIOSName IPv4Address IPv6Address The instance name is used to resolve to a particular TCP/IP port number on which a database instance is hosted. Alternatively, specifying a TCP/IP port number directly is also allowed. If both instance name and port number are not present, the default database instance is used. The Named Pipes format is as follows: np:\\\\<host name>\\pipe\\<pipe name> The Named Pipes format MUST start with the prefix #np:# and is followed by a named pipe name. The host name MUST be specified in one of the following ways: NetBIOSName IPv4Address IPv6Address The pipe name is used to identify the database instance to which the .NET Framework application will be connected. If the value of the Network key is specified, the prefixes #tcp:# and #np:# should not be specified. Note ADO.NET 2.0 does not support asynchronous commands over shared memory for SQL Server 2000 or earlier. However, you can force the use of TCP instead of shared memory, either by prefixing tcp: to the server name in the connection string, or by using localhost. Encrypt 'false' When true, SQL Server uses SSL encryption for all data sent between the client and server if the server has a certificate installed. Recognized values are true, false, yes, and no. Enlist 'true' true indicates that the SQL Server connection pooler automatically enlists the connection in the creation thread's current transaction context. Failover Partner N/A The name of the failover partner server where database mirroring is configured. If the value of this key is ##, then Initial Catalog must be present, and its value must not be ##. The server name can be 128 characters or less. If you specify a failover partner but the failover partner server is not configured for database mirroring and the primary server (specified with the Server keyword) is not available, then the connection will fail. If you specify a failover partner and the primary server is not configured for database mirroring, the connection to the primary server (specified with the Server keyword) will succeed if the primary server is available. The Failover Partner keyword is not supported by .NET Framework version 1.0 or 1.1. Initial Catalog -or- Database N/A The name of the database. The database name can be 128 characters or less. Integrated Security -or- Trusted_Connection 'false' When false, User ID and Password are specified in the connection. When true, the current Windows account credentials are used for authentication. Recognized values are true, false, yes, no, and sspi (strongly recommended), which is equivalent to true. If User ID and Password are specified and Integrated Security is set to true, the User ID and Password will be ignored and Integrated Security will be used. Min Pool Size 0 The minimum number of connections that are allowed in the pool. Valid values are greater than or equal to 0. Zero (0) in this field means no minimum connections are initially opened. Values that are greater than Max Pool Size generate an error. Max Pool Size 100 The maximum number of connections that are allowed in the pool. Valid values are greater than or equal to 1. Values that are less than Min Pool Size generate an error. MultipleActiveResultSets 'false' When true, an application can maintain multiple active result sets (MARS). When false, an application must process or cancel all result sets from one batch before it can execute any  batch on that connection. Recognized values are true and false. The keyword is not supported by .NET Framework version 1.0 or 1.1. Network Library -or- Network -or- Net N/A The network library used to establish a connection to an instance of SQL Server. Supported values include: dbnmpntw (Named Pipes) dbmsrpcn (Multiprotocol, Windows RPC) dbmsadsn (Apple Talk) dbmsgnet (VIA) dbmslpcn (Shared Memory) dbmsspxn (IPX/SPX) dbmssocn (TCP/IP) Dbmsvinn (Banyan Vines) The corresponding network DLL must be installed on the system to which you connect. If you do not specify a network and you use a local server (for example, #.# or #(local)#), shared memory is used. In this example, the network library is Win32 Winsock TCP/IP (dbmssocn), and 1433 is the port being used.    Packet Size 8192 Size in bytes of the network packets used to communicate with an instance of SQL Server. The packet size can be greater than or equal to 512 and less than or equal to 32767. Password -or- PWD N/A The password for the SQL Server account logging on. Not recommended. To maintain a high level of security, we strongly recommend that you use the Integrated Security or Trusted_Connection keyword instead. The password must be 128 characters or less. Persist Security Info -or- PersistSecurityInfo 'false' When set to false or no (strongly recommended), security-sensitive information, such as the password, is not returned as part of the connection if the connection is open or has ever been in an open state. Resetting the connection string resets all connection string values including the password. Recognized values are true, false, yes, and no. Pooling 'true' When the value of this key is set to true, any newly created connection will be added to the pool when closed by the application. In a next attempt to open the same connection, that connection will be drawn from the pool. Connections are considered the same if they have the same connection string. Different connections have different connection strings. The value of this key can be #true#, #false#, #yes#, or #no#. Replication 'false' true if replication is supported using the connection. Transaction Binding Implicit Unbind Controls connection association with an enlisted System.Transactions transaction. Possible values are: Transaction Binding=Implicit Unbind; Transaction Binding=Explicit Unbind; Implicit Unbind causes the connection to detach from the transaction when it ends. After detaching, additional requests on the connection are performed in autocommit mode. The System.Transactions.Transaction.Current property is not checked when executing requests while the transaction is active. After the transaction has ended, additional requests are performed in autocommit mode. If the system ends the transaction (in the scope of a using block) before the last command completes, it will throw InvalidOperationException. Explicit Unbind causes the connection to remain attached to the transaction until the connection is closed or an explicit SqlConnection.TransactionEnlist(null) is called. Beginning in .NET Framework version 4, changes to Implicit Unbind make Explicit Unbind obsolete. An InvalidOperationException is thrown if Transaction.Current is not the enlisted transaction or if the enlisted transaction is not active. TrustServerCertificate 'false' When set to true, SSL is used to encrypt the channel when bypassing walking the certificate chain to validate trust. If TrustServerCertificate is set to true and Encrypt is set to false, the channel is not encrypted. Recognized values are true, false, yes, and no. For more information, see Connection String Syntax (ADO.NET). Type System Version N/A A string value that indicates the type system the application expects. Possible values are: Type System Version=SQL Server 2000; Type System Version=SQL Server 2005; Type System Version=SQL Server 2008; Type System Version=Latest; When set to SQL Server 2000, the SQL Server 2000 type system is used. The following conversions are performed when connecting to a SQL Server 2005 instance: XML to NTEXT UDT to VARBINARY VARCHAR(MAX), NVARCHAR(MAX) and VARBINARY(MAX) to TEXT, NEXT and IMAGE respectively. When set to SQL Server 2005, the SQL Server 2005 type system is used. No conversions are made for the current version of ADO.NET. When set to Latest, the latest version than this client-server pair can handle is used. This will automatically move forward as the client and server components are upgraded. User ID -or- UID -or- N/A The SQL Server login account. Not recommended. To maintain a high level of security, we strongly recommend that you use the Integrated Security or Trusted_Connection keywords instead. The user ID must be 128 characters or less. User Instance 'false' A value that indicates whether to redirect the connection from the default SQL Server Express instance to a runtime-initiated instance running under the account of the caller. Workstation ID -or- WSID The local computer name The name of the workstation connecting to SQL Server. The ID must be 128 characters or less. The following list contains the valid names for connection pooling values within the ConnectionString. For more information, see SQL Server Connection Pooling (ADO.NET). Connection Lifetime (or Load Balance Timeout) Enlist Max Pool Size Min Pool Size Pooling When you are setting keyword or connection pooling values that require a Boolean value, you can use 'yes' instead of 'true', and 'no' instead of 'false'. Integer values are represented as strings. Note The .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server uses its own protocol to communicate with SQL Server. Therefore, it does not support the use of an ODBC data source name (DSN) when connecting to SQL Server because it does not add an ODBC layer. Note Universal data link (UDL) files are not supported for the .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server. Caution In this release, the application should use caution when constructing a connection string based on user input (for example when retrieving user ID and password information from a dialog box, and appending it to the connection string). The application should make sure that a user cannot embed additional connection string parameters in these values (for example, entering a password as #validpassword;database=somedb# in an attempt to attach to a different database). If you need to construct connection strings based on user input, use the new SqlConnectionStringBuilder, which validates the connection string and helps to eliminate this problem. See Connection String Builders (ADO.NET) for more information.

610,33715,464215,467959,8,public class JViewport   ,"The viewport or porthole through which you see the underlying  information. When you scroll, what moves is the viewport. It is like  peering through a camera's viewfinder. Moving the viewfinder upwards brings  new things into view at the top of the picture and loses things that were  at the bottom.  By default, JViewport is opaque. To change this, use the setOpaque method.  NOTE:We have implemented a faster scrolling algorithm that does not require  a buffer to draw in. The algorithm works as follows:     1. The view and parent view and checked to see if they are JComponents,       if they aren't, stop and repaint the whole viewport.    2. If the viewport is obscured by an ancestor, stop and repaint the       whole viewport.    3. Compute the region that will become visible, if it is as big as the       viewport, stop and repaint the whole view region.    4. Obtain the ancestor Window's graphics and do a copyArea on the       scrolled region.    5. Message the view to repaint the newly visible region.    6. The next time paint is invoked on the viewport, if the clip region is       smaller than the viewport size a timer is kicked off to repaint the       whole region. In general this approach is much faster. Compared to the backing store  approach this avoids the overhead of maintaining an offscreen buffer and  having to do two copyAreas. Compared to the non backing store case this  approach will greatly reduce the painted region.  This approach can cause slower times than the backing store approach when  the viewport is obscured by another window, or partially offscreen. When  another window obscures the viewport the copyArea will copy garbage and a  paint event will be generated by the system to inform us we need to paint  the newly exposed region. The only way to handle this is to repaint the  whole viewport, which can cause slower performance than the backing store  case. In most applications very rarely will the user be scrolling while the  viewport is obscured by another window or offscreen, so this optimization  is usually worth the performance hit when obscured.

615,33691,460076,463820,8,public abstract class BaseRowSet   ,"An abstract class providing a RowSet object with its basic functionality.  The basic functions include having properties and sending event  notifications, which all JavaBeansTM components must implement.   1.0 Overview  The BaseRowSet class provides the core functionality for all RowSet  implementations, and all standard implementations may use this class in  combination with one or more RowSet interfaces in order to provide a  standard vendor-specific implementation. To clarify, all implementations  must implement at least one of the RowSet interfaces (JdbcRowSet,  CachedRowSet, JoinRowSet, FilteredRowSet, or WebRowSet). This means that  any implementation that extends the BaseRowSet class must also implement  one of the RowSet interfaces.  The BaseRowSet class provides the following:      * Properties           o Fields for storing current properties           o Methods for getting and setting properties      * Event notification      * A complete set of setter methods for setting the parameters in a        RowSet object's command      * Streams           o Fields for storing stream instances           o Constants for indicating the type of a stream   2.0 Setting Properties  All rowsets maintain a set of properties, which will usually be set using a  tool. The number and kinds of properties a rowset has will vary, depending  on what the RowSet implementation does and how it gets its data. For  example, rowsets that get their data from a ResultSet object need to set  the properties that are required for making a database connection. If a  RowSet object uses the DriverManager facility to make a connection, it  needs to set a property for the JDBC URL that identifies the appropriate  driver, and it needs to set the properties that give the user name and  password. If, on the other hand, the rowset uses a DataSource object to  make the connection, which is the preferred method, it does not need to set  the property for the JDBC URL. Instead, it needs to set the property for  the logical name of the data source along with the properties for the user  name and password.  NOTE: In order to use a DataSource object for making a connection, the  DataSource object must have been registered with a naming service that uses  the Java Naming and Directory InterfaceTM (JNDI) API. This registration is  usually done by a person acting in the capacity of a system administrator.   3.0 Setting the Command and Its Parameters  When a rowset gets its data from a relational database, it executes a  command (a query) that produces a ResultSet object. This query is the  command that is set for the RowSet object's command property. The rowset  populates itself with data by reading the data from the ResultSet object  into itself. If the query contains placeholders for values to be set, the  BaseRowSet setter methods are used to set these values. All setter methods  allow these values to be set to null if required.  The following code fragment illustrates how the CachedRowSetTM object crs  might have its command property set. Note that if a tool is used to set  properties, this is the code that the tool would use.   crs.setCommand(SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS + WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > ? AND REGION = ?);   In this example, the values for CREDIT_LIMIT and REGION are placeholder  parameters, which are indicated with a question mark (?). The first  question mark is placeholder parameter number 1, the second question mark  is placeholder parameter number 2, and so on. Any placeholder parameters  must be set with values before the query can be executed. To set these  placeholder parameters, the BaseRowSet class provides a set of setter  methods, similar to those provided by the PreparedStatement interface, for  setting values of each data type. A RowSet object stores the parameter  values internally, and its execute method uses them internally to set  values for the placeholder parameters before it sends the command to the  DBMS to be executed.  The following code fragment demonstrates setting the two parameters in the  query from the previous example.   crs.setInt(1, 5000); crs.setString(2, West);   If the execute method is called at this point, the query sent to the DBMS  will be:   SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS + WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > 5000 AND REGION = 'West'   NOTE: Setting Array, Clob, Blob and Ref objects as a command parameter,  stores these values as SerialArray, SerialClob, SerialBlob and SerialRef  objects respectively.   4.0 Handling of Parameters Behind the Scenes  NOTE: The BaseRowSet class provides two kinds of setter methods, those that  set properties and those that set placeholder parameters. The setter  methods discussed in this section are those that set placeholder  parameters.  The placeholder parameters set with the BaseRowSet setter methods are  stored as objects in an internal Hashtable object. Primitives are stored as  their Object type. For example, byte is stored as Byte object, and int is  stored as an Integer object. When the method execute is called, the values  in the Hashtable object are substituted for the appropriate placeholder  parameters in the command. <P)> A call to the method getParams returns the  values stored in the Hashtable object as an array of Object instances. An  element in this array may be a simple Object instance or an array (which is  a type of Object). The particular setter method used determines whether an  element in this array is an Object or an array.  The majority of methods for setting placeholder parameters take two  parameters, with the first parameter indicating which placeholder parameter  is to be set, and the second parameter giving the value to be set. Methods  such as getInt, getString, getBoolean, and getLong fall into this category.  After these methods have been called, a call to the method getParams will  return an array with the values that have been set. Each element in the  array is an Object instance representing the values that have been set. The  order of these values in the array is determined by the int (the first  parameter) passed to the setter method. The values in the array are the  values (the second parameter) passed to the setter method. In other words,  the first element in the array is the value to be set for the first  placeholder parameter in the RowSet object's command. The second element is  the value to be set for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.  Several setter methods send the driver and DBMS information beyond the  value to be set. When the method getParams is called after one of these  setter methods has been used, the elements in the array will themselves be  arrays to accommodate the additional information. In this category, the  method setNull is a special case because one version takes only two  parameters (setNull(int parameterIndex, int SqlType)). Nevertheless, it  requires an array to contain the information that will be passed to the  driver and DBMS. The first element in this array is the value to be set,  which is null, and the second element is the int supplied for sqlType,  which indicates the type of SQL value that is being set to null. This  information is needed by some DBMSs and is therefore required in order to  ensure that applications are portable. The other version is intended to be  used when the value to be set to null is a user-defined type. It takes  three parameters (setNull(int parameterIndex, int sqlType, String typeName) ) and also requires an array to contain the information to be passed to the  driver and DBMS. The first two elements in this array are the same as for  the first version of setNull. The third element, typeName, gives the SQL  name of the user-defined type. As is true with the other setter methods,  the number of the placeholder parameter to be set is indicated by an  element's position in the array returned by getParams. So, for example, if  the parameter supplied to setNull is 2, the second element in the array  returned by getParams will be an array of two or three elements.  Some methods, such as setObject and setDate have versions that take more  than two parameters, with the extra parameters giving information to the  driver or the DBMS. For example, the methods setDate, setTime, and  setTimestamp can take a Calendar object as their third parameter. If the  DBMS does not store time zone information, the drivern uses the Calendar  object to construct the Date, Time, or Timestamp object being set. As is  true with other methods that provide additional information, the element in  the array returned by getParams is an array instead of a simple Object  instance.  The methods setAsciiStream, setBinaryStream, setCharacterStream, and  setUnicodeStream (which is deprecated, so applications should use  getCharacterStream instead) take three parameters, so for them, the element  in the array returned by getParams is also an array. What is different  about these setter methods is that in addition to the information provided  by parameters, the array contains one of the BaseRowSet constants  indicating the type of stream being set.  NOTE: The method getParams is called internally by RowSet implementations  extending this class; it is not normally called by an application  programmer directly.   5.0 Event Notification  The BaseRowSet class provides the event notification mechanism for rowsets.  It contains the field listeners, methods for adding and removing listeners,  and methods for notifying listeners of changes.  A listener is an object that has implemented the RowSetListener interface.  If it has been added to a RowSet object's list of listeners, it will be  notified when an event occurs on that RowSet object. Each listener's  implementation of the RowSetListener methods defines what that object will  do when it is notified that an event has occurred.  There are three possible events for a RowSet object:     1. the cursor moves    2. an individual row is changed (updated, deleted, or inserted)    3. the contents of the entire RowSet object are changed  The BaseRowSet method used for the notification indicates the type of event  that has occurred. For example, the method notifyRowChanged indicates that  a row has been updated, deleted, or inserted. Each of the notification  methods creates a RowSetEvent object, which is supplied to the listener in  order to identify the RowSet object on which the event occurred. What the  listener does with this information, which may be nothing, depends on how  it was implemented.   6.0 Default Behavior  A default BaseRowSet object is initialized with many starting values. The  following is true of a default RowSet instance that extends the BaseRowSet  class:     * Has a scrollable cursor and does not show changes made by others.     * Is updatable.     * Does not show rows that have been deleted.     * Has no time limit for how long a driver may take to execute the        RowSet object's command.     * Has no limit for the number of rows it may contain.     * Has no limit for the number of bytes a column may contain. NOTE: This       limit applies only to columns that hold values of the following       types: BINARY, VARBINARY, LONGVARBINARY, CHAR, VARCHAR, and        LONGVARCHAR.     * Will not see uncommitted data (make dirty reads).     * Has escape processing turned on.     * Has its connection's type map set to null.     * Has an empty Vector object for storing the values set for the       placeholder parameters in the RowSet object's command.  If other values are desired, an application must set the property values  explicitly. For example, the following line of code sets the maximum number  of rows for the CachedRowSet object crs to 500.   crs.setMaxRows(500);   Methods implemented in extensions of this BaseRowSet class must throw an  SQLException object for any violation of the defined assertions. Also, if  the extending class overrides and reimplements any BaseRowSet method and  encounters connectivity or underlying data source issues, that method may  in addition throw an SQLException object for that reason.

617,32774,451129,454873,8,public interface Condition ,"Condition factors out the Object monitor methods (wait, notify and  notifyAll) into distinct objects to give the effect of having multiple  wait-sets per object, by combining them with the use of arbitrary Lock  implementations. Where a Lock replaces the use of synchronized methods and  statements, a Condition replaces the use of the Object monitor methods.  Conditions (also known as condition queues or condition variables) provide  a means for one thread to suspend execution (to wait) until notified by  another thread that some state condition may now be true. Because access to  this shared state information occurs in different threads, it must be  protected, so a lock of some form is associated with the condition. The key  property that waiting for a condition provides is that it atomically  releases the associated lock and suspends the current thread, just like  Object.wait.  A Condition instance is intrinsically bound to a lock. To obtain a  Condition instance for a particular Lock instance use its newCondition()  method.  As an example, suppose we have a bounded buffer which supports put and  take methods. If a take is attempted on an empty buffer, then the thread  will block until an item becomes available; if a put is attempted on a full  buffer, then the thread will block until a space becomes available. We  would like to keep waiting put threads and take threads in separate  wait-sets so that we can use the optimization of only notifying a single  thread at a time when items or spaces become available in the buffer. This  can be achieved using two Condition instances.   class BoundedBuffer { final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock(); final Condition notFull  = lock.newCondition();  final Condition notEmpty = lock.newCondition();   final Object[] items = new Object[100]; int putptr, takeptr, count;  public void put(Object x) throws InterruptedException { lock.lock(); try { while (count == items.length) notFull.await(); items[putptr] = x; if (++putptr == items.length) putptr = 0; ++count; notEmpty.signal(); } finally { lock.unlock(); } }  public Object take() throws InterruptedException { lock.lock(); try { while (count == 0) notEmpty.await(); Object x = items[takeptr]; if (++takeptr == items.length) takeptr = 0; --count; notFull.signal(); return x; } finally { lock.unlock(); } } }   (The ArrayBlockingQueue class provides this functionality, so there is no  reason to implement this sample usage class.)  A Condition implementation can provide behavior and semantics that is  different from that of the Object monitor methods, such as guaranteed  ordering for notifications, or not requiring a lock to be held when  performing notifications. If an implementation provides such specialized  semantics then the implementation must document those semantics.  Note that Condition instances are just normal objects and can themselves be  used as the target in a synchronized statement, and can have their own  monitor wait and notification methods invoked. Acquiring the monitor lock  of a Condition instance, or using its monitor methods, has no specified  relationship with acquiring the Lock associated with that Condition or the  use of its waiting and signalling methods. It is recommended that to avoid  confusion you never use Condition instances in this way, except perhaps  within their own implementation.  Except where noted, passing a null value for any parameter will result in a  NullPointerException being thrown.   Implementation Considerations  When waiting upon a Condition, a spurious wakeup is permitted to occur,  in general, as a concession to the underlying platform semantics. This has  little practical impact on most application programs as a Condition should  always be waited upon in a loop, testing the state predicate that is being  waited for. An implementation is free to remove the possibility of spurious  wakeups but it is recommended that applications programmers always assume  that they can occur and so always wait in a loop.  The three forms of condition waiting (interruptible, non-interruptible, and  timed) may differ in their ease of implementation on some platforms and in  their performance characteristics. In particular, it may be difficult to  provide these features and maintain specific semantics such as ordering  guarantees. Further, the ability to interrupt the actual suspension of the  thread may not always be feasible to implement on all platforms.  Consequently, an implementation is not required to define exactly the same  guarantees or semantics for all three forms of waiting, nor is it required  to support interruption of the actual suspension of the thread.  An implementation is required to clearly document the semantics and  guarantees provided by each of the waiting methods, and when an  implementation does support interruption of thread suspension then it must  obey the interruption semantics as defined in this interface.  As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for interruption  are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding to an  interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be shown  that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked the  thread. An implementation should document this behavior.

It is like  peering through a camera's viewfinder. Moving the viewfinder upwards brings  new things into view at the top of the picture and loses things that were  at the bottom.  By default, JViewport is opaque. To change this, use the setOpaque method.  NOTE:We have implemented a faster scrolling algorithm that does not require  a buffer to draw in. The algorithm works as follows:     1. The view and parent view and checked to see if they are JComponents,       if they aren't, stop and repaint the whole viewport.    2. If the viewport is obscured by an ancestor, stop and repaint the       whole viewport.    3. Compute the region that will become visible, if it is as big as the       viewport, stop and repaint the whole view region.    4. Obtain the ancestor Window's graphics and do a copyArea on the       scrolled region.    5. Message the view to repaint the newly visible region.    6. The next time paint is invoked on the viewport, if the clip region is       smaller than the viewport size a timer is kicked off to repaint the       whole region. In general this approach is much faster. Compared to the backing store  approach this avoids the overhead of maintaining an offscreen buffer and  having to do two copyAreas. Compared to the non backing store case this  approach will greatly reduce the painted region.  This approach can cause slower times than the backing store approach when  the viewport is obscured by another window, or partially offscreen. When  another window obscures the viewport the copyArea will copy garbage and a  paint event will be generated by the system to inform us we need to paint  the newly exposed region. The only way to handle this is to repaint the  whole viewport, which can cause slower performance than the backing store  case. In most applications very rarely will the user be scrolling while the  viewport is obscured by another window or offscreen, so this optimization  is usually worth the performance hit when obscured.

659,33485,457933,461677,8,public final class JobKOctets   ,"Class JobKOctets is an integer valued printing attribute class that  specifies the total size of the document(s) in K octets, i.e., in units of  1024 octets requested to be processed in the job. The value must be rounded  up, so that a job between 1 and 1024 octets must be indicated as being 1K  octets, 1025 to 2048 must be 2K octets, etc. For a multidoc print job (a  job with multiple documents), the JobKOctets value is computed by adding up  the individual documents' sizes in octets, then rounding up to the next K  octets value.  The JobKOctets attribute describes the size of the job. This attribute is  not intended to be a counter; it is intended to be useful routing and  scheduling information if known. The printer may try to compute the  JobKOctets attribute's value if it is not supplied in the Print Request.  Even if the client does supply a value for the JobKOctets attribute in the  Print Request, the printer may choose to change the value if the printer is  able to compute a value which is more accurate than the client supplied  value. The printer may be able to determine the correct value for the  JobKOctets attribute either right at job submission time or at any later  point in time.  The JobKOctets value must not include the multiplicative factors  contributed by the number of copies specified by the Copies attribute,  independent of whether the device can process multiple copies without  making multiple passes over the job or document data and independent of  whether the output is collated or not. Thus the value is independent of the  implementation and indicates the size of the document(s) measured in K  octets independent of the number of copies.  The JobKOctets value must also not include the multiplicative factor due to  a copies instruction embedded in the document data. If the document data  actually includes replications of the document data, this value will  include such replication. In other words, this value is always the size of  the source document data, rather than a measure of the hardcopy output to  be produced.  The size of a doc is computed based on the print data representation class  as specified by the doc's DocFlavor, as shown in the table below.  Representation Class 	Document Size byte[] 	Length of the byte array java.io.InputStream 	Number of bytes read from the stream char[] 	Length of the character array x 2 java.lang.String 	Length of the string x 2 java.io.Reader 	Number of characters read from the stream x 2 java.net.URL 	Number of bytes read from the file at the given URL address java.awt.image.renderable.RenderableImage 	Implementation dependent* java.awt.print.Printable 	Implementation dependent* java.awt.print.Pageable 	Implementation dependent*  * In these cases the Print Service itself generates the print data sent to  the printer. If the Print Service supports the JobKOctets attribute, for  these cases the Print Service itself must calculate the size of the print  data, replacing any JobKOctets value the client specified.  IPP Compatibility: The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The  category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.

This class cannot be inherited. Remarks: BYOT (Bring Your Own Transaction) allows a component to be created with or to inherit an external transaction. That is, a component that does not already have an associated transaction can acquire a transaction. COM+ allows setting an arbitrary pre-existing Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) or Transaction Internet Protocol (TIP) transaction as the transaction property of a new component's context. This allows COM+ components to be associated with transactions whose lifetimes are controlled by a transaction processing (TP) monitor, Object/Task Selector (OTS), or database management system (DBMS). BYOT transactions must be used with caution. In certain situations, they can result in a transaction spanning multiple synchronization domains-that is, they allow parallelism with another transaction, causing a deadlock condition.

676,33749,462371,466115,8,public class JLayeredPane   ,"JLayeredPane adds depth to a JFC/Swing container, allowing components to  overlap each other when needed. An Integer object specifies each  component's depth in the container, where higher-numbered components sit  on top of other components. For task-oriented documentation and examples  of using layered panes see How to Use a Layered Pane, a section in The Java  Tutorial.  [The following text describes this image.]  For convenience, JLayeredPane divides the depth-range into several  different layers. Putting a component into one of those layers makes it  easy to ensure that components overlap properly, without having to worry  about specifying numbers for specific depths: DEFAULT_LAYER     The standard layer, where most components go. This the bottommost     layer. PALETTE_LAYER     The palette layer sits over the default layer. Useful for floating     toolbars and palettes, so they can be positioned above other     components. MODAL_LAYER     The layer used for modal dialogs. They will appear on top of any     toolbars, palettes, or standard components in the container. POPUP_LAYER     The popup layer displays above dialogs. That way, the popup windows     associated with combo boxes, tooltips, and other help text will appear     above the component, palette, or dialog that generated them. DRAG_LAYER     When dragging a component, reassigning it to the drag layer ensures     that it is positioned over every other component in the container. When     finished dragging, it can be reassigned to its normal layer. The JLayeredPane methods moveToFront(Component), moveToBack(Component) and  setPosition can be used to reposition a component within its layer. The  setLayer method can also be used to change the component's current layer.   Details  JLayeredPane manages its list of children like Container, but allows for  the definition of a several layers within itself. Children in the same  layer are managed exactly like the normal Container object, with the added  feature that when children components overlap, children in higher layers  display above the children in lower layers.  Each layer is a distinct integer number. The layer attribute can be set on  a Component by passing an Integer object during the add call. For example:   layeredPane.add(child, JLayeredPane.DEFAULT_LAYER); or layeredPane.add(child, new Integer(10));   The layer attribute can also be set on a Component by calling   layeredPaneParent.setLayer(child, 10)  on the JLayeredPane that is the parent of component. The layer should be  set before adding the child to the parent.  Higher number layers display above lower number layers. So, using numbers  for the layers and letters for individual components, a representative list  order would look like this:   5a, 5b, 5c, 2a, 2b, 2c, 1a   where the leftmost components are closest to the top of the display.  A component can be moved to the top or bottom position within its layer by  calling moveToFront or moveToBack.  The position of a component within a layer can also be specified directly.  Valid positions range from 0 up to one less than the number of components  in that layer. A value of -1 indicates the bottommost position. A value of  0 indicates the topmost position. Unlike layer numbers, higher position  values are lower in the display.      Note: This sequence (defined by java.awt.Container) is the reverse of     the layer numbering sequence. Usually though, you will use moveToFront     , moveToBack, and setLayer.  Here are some examples using the method add(Component, layer, position):  Calling add(5x, 5, -1) results in:   5a, 5b, 5c, 5x, 2a, 2b, 2c, 1a   Calling add(5z, 5, 2) results in:   5a, 5b, 5z, 5c, 5x, 2a, 2b, 2c, 1a   Calling add(3a, 3, 7) results in:   5a, 5b, 5z, 5c, 5x, 3a, 2a, 2b, 2c, 1a   Using normal paint/event mechanics results in 1a appearing at the bottom  and 5a being above all other components.  Note: that these layers are simply a logical construct and LayoutManagers  will affect all child components of this container without regard for layer  settings.  Warning: Swing is not thread safe.

Remarks: You can use client application services to retrieve role information from an existing roles service by configuring your application to use the ClientRoleProvider class. After configuration, you can determine whether an authenticated user is in a particular role by calling the IsInRole method of the IPrincipal returned by the static Thread.CurrentPrincipal property. For applications configured to use client application services, this property returns a ClientRolePrincipal. Because this class implements the IPrincipal interface, you do not need to reference it explicitly. The ClientRolePrincipal.IsInRole method internally calls the ClientRoleProvider.IsUserInRole method. The ClientRoleProvider class is a read-only role membership provider that retrieves role information for authenticated users from the roles service indicated by the ServiceUri property. The value of the ServiceUri property is typically retrieved from the application configuration file along with other configuration values. For more information, see How to: Configure Client Application Services. You can retrieve the current ClientRoleProvider instance through the static Roles.Provider property. The ClientRoleProvider class supports only the GetRolesForUser and IsUserInRole methods of the RoleProvider abstract class. When you call one of these methods for a particular user, the service provider first checks the local data cache for role information. If the cache does not contain any role information or the cache has expired, the service provider retrieves the role information from the roles service and adds it to the cache. You can specify the time-out period for the roles cache when you configure client application services. To force the GetRolesForUser method to retrieve role data from the service instead of the local cache, call the ResetCache method first. You cannot use the ClientRoleProvider class to create or delete roles, or to modify the role membership of users. To create or modify role information, you must change the configuration of the role service on the server. Example: The following example code demonstrates how to use this property to programmatically set the roles service location.

For some queries, such as those involving a sort (OrderBy, OrderByDescending), buffering is essential and a hint of NotBuffered or AutoBuffered will be ignored. However, queries that are created by using the AsOrdered operator can be streamed as long as no further sorting is performed within the query itself. Use AutoBuffered for most cases; this is the default. It strikes a balance between latency and overall performance. Use FullyBuffered for queries when the entire output can be processed before the information is needed.

Remarks: The SqlWorkflowPersistenceService class represents a fully-functional persistence service. You can use this service out-of-box to persist and retrieve workflow state information about a workflow instance when requested to by the workflow runtime engine. The SqlWorkflowPersistenceService participates in the workflow transaction batching functionality provided by the WorkflowCommitWorkBatchService. That is, it adds objects that represent pending writes to the SQL database to the WorkBatch and implements the IPendingWork interface. The SqlWorkflowPersistenceService supports locking of workflow instances. This feature is used when several workflow runtimes share the same database. A column in the SQL database table is used to mark a workflow instance as locked whenever it is being used by a workflow runtime. The SqlWorkflowPersistenceService does not load a workflow instance that is marked as #in use# by another runtime. Typically these locks are released when the workflow instance is persisted, for example, on idle, completion, or termination. The locks can also be released automatically after a period of inactivity. This period of inactivity can be set using the constructor of the SqlWorkflowPersistenceService class. It can also be set through the configuration file. For more information about persistence services in general, see the WorkflowPersistenceService class. Workflow instances can contain timers, for example, if they have a DelayActivity. For workflows that contain timers, the SqlWorkflowPersistenceService records the time when the workflow's next timer expires. The SqlWorkflowPersistenceService periodically polls the database, looking for workflows whose timers have expired. The frequency of the polling interval can be set using the SqlWorkflowPersistenceService constructor or using a configuration file. Note When using both the SqlTrackingService and the SqlWorkflowPersistenceService in a workflow application, it is recommended to use a single database for both persistence and tracking.

If UserEdit is set to true, the string is matched to one of the values in the collection prior to updating the control's text display. Example: The following code example creates and initializes a DomainUpDown control. The example allows you to set some of its properties and create a collection of strings for display in the spin box. The code assumes that a TextBox, CheckBox, and Button have been instantiated on a form. The example also assumes that you have a member variable at the class level declared as a 32-bit signed integer named myCounter. You can enter a string in the text box and add it to the Items collection when the button is clicked. By clicking the check box, you can toggle the Sorted property and observe the difference in the collection of items in the spin box.

706,33691,460076,463820,8,public abstract class BaseRowSet   ,"An abstract class providing a RowSet object with its basic functionality.  The basic functions include having properties and sending event  notifications, which all JavaBeansTM components must implement.   1.0 Overview  The BaseRowSet class provides the core functionality for all RowSet  implementations, and all standard implementations may use this class in  combination with one or more RowSet interfaces in order to provide a  standard vendor-specific implementation. To clarify, all implementations  must implement at least one of the RowSet interfaces (JdbcRowSet,  CachedRowSet, JoinRowSet, FilteredRowSet, or WebRowSet). This means that  any implementation that extends the BaseRowSet class must also implement  one of the RowSet interfaces.  The BaseRowSet class provides the following:      * Properties           o Fields for storing current properties           o Methods for getting and setting properties      * Event notification      * A complete set of setter methods for setting the parameters in a        RowSet object's command      * Streams           o Fields for storing stream instances           o Constants for indicating the type of a stream   2.0 Setting Properties  All rowsets maintain a set of properties, which will usually be set using a  tool. The number and kinds of properties a rowset has will vary, depending  on what the RowSet implementation does and how it gets its data. For  example, rowsets that get their data from a ResultSet object need to set  the properties that are required for making a database connection. If a  RowSet object uses the DriverManager facility to make a connection, it  needs to set a property for the JDBC URL that identifies the appropriate  driver, and it needs to set the properties that give the user name and  password. If, on the other hand, the rowset uses a DataSource object to  make the connection, which is the preferred method, it does not need to set  the property for the JDBC URL. Instead, it needs to set the property for  the logical name of the data source along with the properties for the user  name and password.  NOTE: In order to use a DataSource object for making a connection, the  DataSource object must have been registered with a naming service that uses  the Java Naming and Directory InterfaceTM (JNDI) API. This registration is  usually done by a person acting in the capacity of a system administrator.   3.0 Setting the Command and Its Parameters  When a rowset gets its data from a relational database, it executes a  command (a query) that produces a ResultSet object. This query is the  command that is set for the RowSet object's command property. The rowset  populates itself with data by reading the data from the ResultSet object  into itself. If the query contains placeholders for values to be set, the  BaseRowSet setter methods are used to set these values. All setter methods  allow these values to be set to null if required.  The following code fragment illustrates how the CachedRowSetTM object crs  might have its command property set. Note that if a tool is used to set  properties, this is the code that the tool would use.   crs.setCommand(SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS + WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > ? AND REGION = ?);   In this example, the values for CREDIT_LIMIT and REGION are placeholder  parameters, which are indicated with a question mark (?). The first  question mark is placeholder parameter number 1, the second question mark  is placeholder parameter number 2, and so on. Any placeholder parameters  must be set with values before the query can be executed. To set these  placeholder parameters, the BaseRowSet class provides a set of setter  methods, similar to those provided by the PreparedStatement interface, for  setting values of each data type. A RowSet object stores the parameter  values internally, and its execute method uses them internally to set  values for the placeholder parameters before it sends the command to the  DBMS to be executed.  The following code fragment demonstrates setting the two parameters in the  query from the previous example.   crs.setInt(1, 5000); crs.setString(2, West);   If the execute method is called at this point, the query sent to the DBMS  will be:   SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS + WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > 5000 AND REGION = 'West'   NOTE: Setting Array, Clob, Blob and Ref objects as a command parameter,  stores these values as SerialArray, SerialClob, SerialBlob and SerialRef  objects respectively.   4.0 Handling of Parameters Behind the Scenes  NOTE: The BaseRowSet class provides two kinds of setter methods, those that  set properties and those that set placeholder parameters. The setter  methods discussed in this section are those that set placeholder  parameters.  The placeholder parameters set with the BaseRowSet setter methods are  stored as objects in an internal Hashtable object. Primitives are stored as  their Object type. For example, byte is stored as Byte object, and int is  stored as an Integer object. When the method execute is called, the values  in the Hashtable object are substituted for the appropriate placeholder  parameters in the command. <P)> A call to the method getParams returns the  values stored in the Hashtable object as an array of Object instances. An  element in this array may be a simple Object instance or an array (which is  a type of Object). The particular setter method used determines whether an  element in this array is an Object or an array.  The majority of methods for setting placeholder parameters take two  parameters, with the first parameter indicating which placeholder parameter  is to be set, and the second parameter giving the value to be set. Methods  such as getInt, getString, getBoolean, and getLong fall into this category.  After these methods have been called, a call to the method getParams will  return an array with the values that have been set. Each element in the  array is an Object instance representing the values that have been set. The  order of these values in the array is determined by the int (the first  parameter) passed to the setter method. The values in the array are the  values (the second parameter) passed to the setter method. In other words,  the first element in the array is the value to be set for the first  placeholder parameter in the RowSet object's command. The second element is  the value to be set for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.  Several setter methods send the driver and DBMS information beyond the  value to be set. When the method getParams is called after one of these  setter methods has been used, the elements in the array will themselves be  arrays to accommodate the additional information. In this category, the  method setNull is a special case because one version takes only two  parameters (setNull(int parameterIndex, int SqlType)). Nevertheless, it  requires an array to contain the information that will be passed to the  driver and DBMS. The first element in this array is the value to be set,  which is null, and the second element is the int supplied for sqlType,  which indicates the type of SQL value that is being set to null. This  information is needed by some DBMSs and is therefore required in order to  ensure that applications are portable. The other version is intended to be  used when the value to be set to null is a user-defined type. It takes  three parameters (setNull(int parameterIndex, int sqlType, String typeName) ) and also requires an array to contain the information to be passed to the  driver and DBMS. The first two elements in this array are the same as for  the first version of setNull. The third element, typeName, gives the SQL  name of the user-defined type. As is true with the other setter methods,  the number of the placeholder parameter to be set is indicated by an  element's position in the array returned by getParams. So, for example, if  the parameter supplied to setNull is 2, the second element in the array  returned by getParams will be an array of two or three elements.  Some methods, such as setObject and setDate have versions that take more  than two parameters, with the extra parameters giving information to the  driver or the DBMS. For example, the methods setDate, setTime, and  setTimestamp can take a Calendar object as their third parameter. If the  DBMS does not store time zone information, the drivern uses the Calendar  object to construct the Date, Time, or Timestamp object being set. As is  true with other methods that provide additional information, the element in  the array returned by getParams is an array instead of a simple Object  instance.  The methods setAsciiStream, setBinaryStream, setCharacterStream, and  setUnicodeStream (which is deprecated, so applications should use  getCharacterStream instead) take three parameters, so for them, the element  in the array returned by getParams is also an array. What is different  about these setter methods is that in addition to the information provided  by parameters, the array contains one of the BaseRowSet constants  indicating the type of stream being set.  NOTE: The method getParams is called internally by RowSet implementations  extending this class; it is not normally called by an application  programmer directly.   5.0 Event Notification  The BaseRowSet class provides the event notification mechanism for rowsets.  It contains the field listeners, methods for adding and removing listeners,  and methods for notifying listeners of changes.  A listener is an object that has implemented the RowSetListener interface.  If it has been added to a RowSet object's list of listeners, it will be  notified when an event occurs on that RowSet object. Each listener's  implementation of the RowSetListener methods defines what that object will  do when it is notified that an event has occurred.  There are three possible events for a RowSet object:     1. the cursor moves    2. an individual row is changed (updated, deleted, or inserted)    3. the contents of the entire RowSet object are changed  The BaseRowSet method used for the notification indicates the type of event  that has occurred. For example, the method notifyRowChanged indicates that  a row has been updated, deleted, or inserted. Each of the notification  methods creates a RowSetEvent object, which is supplied to the listener in  order to identify the RowSet object on which the event occurred. What the  listener does with this information, which may be nothing, depends on how  it was implemented.   6.0 Default Behavior  A default BaseRowSet object is initialized with many starting values. The  following is true of a default RowSet instance that extends the BaseRowSet  class:     * Has a scrollable cursor and does not show changes made by others.     * Is updatable.     * Does not show rows that have been deleted.     * Has no time limit for how long a driver may take to execute the        RowSet object's command.     * Has no limit for the number of rows it may contain.     * Has no limit for the number of bytes a column may contain. NOTE: This       limit applies only to columns that hold values of the following       types: BINARY, VARBINARY, LONGVARBINARY, CHAR, VARCHAR, and        LONGVARCHAR.     * Will not see uncommitted data (make dirty reads).     * Has escape processing turned on.     * Has its connection's type map set to null.     * Has an empty Vector object for storing the values set for the       placeholder parameters in the RowSet object's command.  If other values are desired, an application must set the property values  explicitly. For example, the following line of code sets the maximum number  of rows for the CachedRowSet object crs to 500.   crs.setMaxRows(500);   Methods implemented in extensions of this BaseRowSet class must throw an  SQLException object for any violation of the defined assertions. Also, if  the extending class overrides and reimplements any BaseRowSet method and  encounters connectivity or underlying data source issues, that method may  in addition throw an SQLException object for that reason.

This class cannot be inherited. Remarks: The Membership class is used in ASP.NET applications to validate user credentials and manage user settings such as passwords and e-mail addresses. The Membership class can be used on its own, or in conjunction with the FormsAuthentication to create a complete system for authenticating users of a Web application or site. The Login control encapsulates the Membership class to provide a convenient mechanism for validating users. Note If you are not familiar with the membership features of ASP.NET, see Introduction to Membership before continuing. For a list of  topics related to membership, see Managing Users by Using Membership. The Membership class provides facilities for: Creating new users. Storing membership information (user names, passwords, e-mail addresses, and supporting data) in Microsoft SQL Server or in an alternative data store. Authenticating users who visit your site. You can authenticate users programmatically, or you can use the Login control to create a complete authentication system that requires little or no code. Managing passwords, which includes creating, changing, retrieving, and resetting them, and so on. You can optionally configure ASP.NET membership to require a password question and answer to authenticate password reset or retrieval requests for users that have forgotten their password. Although ASP.NET membership is a self-standing feature in ASP.NET For authentication, it can be integrated with ASP.NET role management to provide authorization services for your site. Membership can also be integrated with the ASP.NET user System.Web.Profile to provide application-specific customization that can be tailored to individual users. For details, see Understanding Role Management and ASP.NET Profile Properties Overview. The Membership class relies on membership providers to communicate with a data source. The .NET Framework includes a SqlMembershipProvider, which stores user information in a Microsoft SQL Server database, and an ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider, which enables you to store user information on an Active Directory or Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM) server. You can also implement a custom membership provider to communicate with an alternative data source that can be used by the Membership class. Custom membership providers inherit the MembershipProvider abstract class. For more information, see Implementing a Membership Provider. By default, ASP.NET membership is enabled for all ASP.NET applications. The default membership provider is the SqlMembershipProvider and is specified in the machine configuration with the name AspNetSqlProvider. The default instance of the SqlMembershipProvider is configured to connect to a local instance of Microsoft SQL Server. You can modify the default settings to specify a SqlMembershipProvider  than the AspNetSqlProvider instance as the default provider, or specify an instance of a custom provider as the default provider for your ASP.NET application using the Web.config file. You can specify the ASP.NET membership configuration for your Web application using the membership configuration section in the Web.config file. You can use the providers subsection of the membership section to specify a membership provider  than one of the default providers. For example, the following membership section removes the default membership providers from the current application configuration and adds a new provider with a name of SqlProvider that connects to a SQL Server instance named AspSqlServer.  Topic Location Walkthrough: Creating a Web Site with Membership and User Login (Visual Studio) Building ASP .NET Web Applications in Visual Studio Example: The following code example shows the login page for an ASP.NET application configured to use forms authentication and ASP.NET membership. If the supplied user credentials are invalid, a message is displayed to the user. Otherwise, the user is redirected to the originally requested URL using the RedirectFromLoginPage method. Note The ASP.NET login controls (Login, LoginView, LoginStatus, LoginName, and PasswordRecovery) encapsulate virtually all of the logic required to prompt users for credentials and validate the credentials in the membership system and can be used in place of programmatic checking using the Membership class. Security Note This example contains a text box that accepts user input, which is a potential security threat. By default, ASP.NET Web pages validate that user input does not include script or HTML elements. For more information, see Script Exploits Overview.

Remarks: The interface to an XML Web service is typically described by a Web Services Description Language (WSDL) file. For example, to obtain a WSDL description of a Web service using ASP.NET exposed at http://localhost/service.asmx, simply navigate to http://localhost/service.asmx?WSDL. The ServiceDescriptionImporter class allows you to easily import the information contained in a WSDL description into a System.CodeDom.CodeCompileUnit object. By adjusting the value of the Style parameter, you can instruct a ServiceDescriptionImporter instance either to generate a client proxy class that provides the functionality of the Web service by transparently calling it or to generate an abstract class that encapsulates the functionality of the Web service without implementing it. The code in the resulting CodeCompileUnit object can then either be called directly or exported in the language of your choice. Example: The following example illustrates the use of the ServiceDescriptionImporter class to generate proxy client code that calls an XML Web service described by a WSDL file.

Return Value Type: TResult The maximum value in the sequence. Usage Note In Visual Basic and C\#, you can call this method as an instance method on any object of type IQueryable(Of TSource). When you use instance method syntax to call this method, omit the first parameter. For more information, see Extension Methods (Visual Basic) or Extension Methods (C\# Programming Guide). Summary: Invokes a projection function on each element of a generic IQueryable(Of T) and returns the maximum resulting value. Remarks: This method has at least one parameter of type Expression(Of TDelegate) whose type argument is one of the Func(Of T, TResult) types. For these parameters, you can pass in a lambda expression and it will be compiled to an Expression(Of TDelegate). The Max(Of TSource, TResult)(IQueryable(Of TSource), Expression(Of Func(Of TSource, TResult))) method generates a MethodCallExpression that represents calling Max(Of TSource, TResult)(IQueryable(Of TSource), Expression(Of Func(Of TSource, TResult))) itself as a constructed generic method. It then passes the MethodCallExpression to the Execute(Of TResult)(Expression) method of the IQueryProvider represented by the Provider property of the source parameter. The query behavior that occurs as a result of executing an expression tree that represents calling Max(Of TSource, TResult)(IQueryable(Of TSource), Expression(Of Func(Of TSource, TResult))) depends on the implementation of the type of the source parameter. The expected behavior is that it invokes selector on each element in source and returns the maximum value.

736,32468,444671,448415,8,public final class URL   ,"Class URL represents a Uniform Resource Locator, a pointer to a resource  on the World Wide Web. A resource can be something as simple as a file or a  directory, or it can be a reference to a more complicated object, such as a  query to a database or to a search engine. More information on the types of  URLs and their formats can be found at:      http://www.socs.uts.edu.au/MosaicDocs-old/url-primer.html  In general, a URL can be broken into several parts. The previous example of  a URL indicates that the protocol to use is http (HyperText Transfer  Protocol) and that the information resides on a host machine named  www.socs.uts.edu.au. The information on that host machine is named  /MosaicDocs-old/url-primer.html. The exact meaning of this name on the host  machine is both protocol dependent and host dependent. The information  normally resides in a file, but it could be generated on the fly. This  component of the URL is called the path component.  A URL can optionally specify a port, which is the port number to which  the TCP connection is made on the remote host machine. If the port is not  specified, the default port for the protocol is used instead. For example,  the default port for http is 80. An alternative port could be specified as:       http://www.socs.uts.edu.au:80/MosaicDocs-old/url-primer.html   The syntax of URL is defined by RFC 2396: Uniform Resource Identifiers  (URI): Generic Syntax, amended by RFC 2732: Format for Literal IPv6  Addresses in URLs. The Literal IPv6 address format also supports scope_ids.  The syntax and usage of scope_ids is described here.  A URL may have appended to it a fragment, also known as a ref or a  reference. The fragment is indicated by the sharp sign character \#  followed by more characters. For example,       http://java.sun.com/index.html\#chapter1   This fragment is not technically part of the URL. Rather, it indicates that  after the specified resource is retrieved, the application is specifically  interested in that part of the document that has the tag chapter1 attached  to it. The meaning of a tag is resource specific.  An application can also specify a relative URL, which contains only  enough information to reach the resource relative to another URL. Relative  URLs are frequently used within HTML pages. For example, if the contents of  the URL:       http://java.sun.com/index.html   contained within it the relative URL:       FAQ.html   it would be a shorthand for:       http://java.sun.com/FAQ.html   The relative URL need not specify all the components of a URL. If the  protocol, host name, or port number is missing, the value is inherited from  the fully specified URL. The file component must be specified. The optional  fragment is not inherited.  The URL class does not itself encode or decode any URL components according  to the escaping mechanism defined in RFC2396. It is the responsibility of  the caller to encode any fields, which need to be escaped prior to calling  URL, and also to decode any escaped fields, that are returned from URL.  Furthermore, because URL has no knowledge of URL escaping, it does not  recognise equivalence between the encoded or decoded form of the same URL.  For example, the two URLs:      http://foo.com/hello world/ and http://foo.com/hello%20world  would be considered not equal to each other.  Note, the URI class does perform escaping of its component fields in  certain circumstances. The recommended way to manage the encoding and  decoding of URLs is to use URI, and to convert between these two classes  using toURI() and URI.toURL().  The URLEncoder and URLDecoder classes can also be used, but only for HTML  form encoding, which is not the same as the encoding scheme defined in  RFC2396.

Remarks: An XslTransformFileEditor object is used at design time to select and edit a URL for a XML transform file (.xsl) and to assign the URL to a control property. For example, the XmlDataSource control uses the XslTransformFileEditor class at design time to set the value of the TransformFile property. Use the EditorAttribute attribute to associate the XslTransformFileEditor with a property. When the associated property is edited on the design surface, the designer host calls the EditValue method. The EditValue method uses the BuildUrl method, which in turn displays a user interface for selecting the URL, and then returns the URL that is selected by the user. The GetEditStyle method indicates the display style of the user interface. Derive a class from the XslTransformFileEditor to define a custom editor for an XML transform file URL property. For example, a derived class can override the EditValue method, and then call the BuildUrl method with a custom Filter or Caption value. Example: The following code example demonstrates how to associate an instance of the XslTransformFileEditor class with a property that is contained within a custom control.

Applications typically only deal with the  classes that implement this interface, supplying them with any information  required for a particular extended operation request. It would then pass  such a class as an argument to the LdapContext.extendedOperation() method  for performing the LDAPv3 extended operation.  For example, suppose the LDAP server supported a 'get time' extended  operation. It would supply GetTimeRequest and GetTimeResponse classes:       public class GetTimeRequest implements ExtendedRequest { public GetTimeRequest() {... }; public ExtendedResponse createExtendedResponse(String id, byte[] berValue, int offset, int length) throws NamingException { return new GetTimeResponse(id, berValue, offset, length); } ... } public class GetTimeResponse implements ExtendedResponse { long time; public GetTimeResponse(String id, byte[] berValue, int offset, int length) throws NamingException { time = ... // decode berValue to get time } public java.util.Date getDate() { return new java.util.Date(time) }; public long getTime() { return time }; ... }   A program would use then these classes as follows:       GetTimeResponse resp = (GetTimeResponse) ectx.extendedOperation(new GetTimeRequest()); long time = resp.getTime();   Since:     1.3 See Also:     ExtendedResponse,      LdapContext.extendedOperation(javax.naming.ldap.ExtendedRequest)",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,4,216,clean

Remarks: A contract is a collection of operations that specifies what the endpoint communicates to the outside world. Each operation is a message exchange. For example, a request message and an associated reply message form a request/reply message exchange. A ContractDescription object is used to describe contracts and their operations. Within a ContractDescription, each contract operation has a corresponding OperationDescription that describes aspects of the each operation that is part of the contract, such as whether the operation is one-way or request/reply. Each OperationDescription also describes the messages that make up the operation using a MessageDescriptionCollection. ContractDescription contains a reference to an interface that defines the contract using the programming model. This interface is marked with ServiceContractAttribute and its methods that correspond to endpoint operations are marked with the OperationContractAttribute. A duplex contract defines the following logical sets of operations: A set that the service exposes for the client to call. A set that the client exposes for the service to call. The programming model for defining a duplex contract is to split each set in a separate interface and apply attributes to each interface. In this case, ContractDescription contains a reference to each of the interfaces that groups them into one duplex contract. Similar to bindings, each contract has a Name and Namespace that uniquely identify it in the metadata of the service.

During deserialization, JavaScriptSerializer can then reference this string value to determine the appropriate managed type to which the JSON string will be converted. If you provide a type resolver to the JavaScriptSerializer instance, the serializer will use the ResolveTypeId and ResolveType methods to map between the managed type and the string value during the serialization and deserialization process, respectively.

This class cannot be inherited. Remarks: To create an OracleDataReader, you must call the ExecuteReader method of the OracleCommand object, rather than directly using a constructor. Changes made to a resultset by an process or thread while data is being read may be visible to the user of the OracleDataReader. IsClosed and RecordsAffected are the only properties that you can call after the OracleDataReader is closed. In some cases, you must call Close before you can call RecordsAffected. More than one OracleDataReader can be open at any given time. The following two Visual Basic examples demonstrate how to use an OracleDataReader to retrieve an Oracle REF CURSOR. These examples use tables that are defined in the Oracle Scott/Tiger schema, and require the following PL/SQL package and package body. You must create these on your server to use the examples. Create the following Oracle package on the Oracle server.  Create the following Oracle package body on the Oracle server.    This Visual Basic example executes a PL/SQL stored procedure that returns a REF CURSOR parameter, and reads the value as an OracleDataReader.    This Visual Basic example executes a PL/SQL stored procedure that returns two REF CURSOR parameters, and reads the values using an OracleDataReader.    This  example creates an Oracle table and loads it with data. You must run this example prior to running the subsequent example, which demonstrates using an OracleDataReader to access the data using OracleType structures.

For information about how to develop ASP.NET mobile applications, see the www.asp.net/mobile Web site. Remarks: XHTML is an XML-compliant markup that is based on HTML 4.1 and allows you to create Web sites suitable for multiple device types. It merges HTML's ease of use with XML's strict element guidelines to produce a markup language with a wide range of format and style options and reduced markup tag ambiguity. This class provides formatting capabilities that ASP.NET server controls use when rendering XHTML content to clients. The XhtmlMobileTextWriter renders markup that meets the standards of three different XHTML doc types: XHTML Basic, which supports limited style and format elements; XHTML Mobile Profile, which supports inline style sheets; and WML 2.0, which is based on XHTML 1.1 and supports cascading style sheets. This class is used primarily by developers of custom mobile page and control adapters. The XhtmlMobileTextWriter class can render all HTML elements, attributes, and style attributes, but, unlike the HtmlTextWriter class, does not allow title capitalization of these markup elements. An XhtmlPageAdapter instantiates an XhtmlMobileTextWriter and depending on the capabilities of the target device, initializes a number of properties, such as SupportsNoWrapStyle, SuppressNewLine, and UseDivsForBreaks, that assist the text writer in rendering the page and its controls. Your adapter can use a variety of methods to apply styles and control formatting: EnterStyle and ExitStyle, EnterLayout and ExitLayout, and EnterFormat and ExitFormat. Note This class derives from the MobileTextWriter class, which in turn derives from the MultiPartWriter class, and much of its functionality is provided by these base classes. You can use the members of this class, and any members it inherits from the MobileTextWriter class, to create custom text writers to use in a custom XHTML page or in class adapters. You can also create new derived classes that override the standard behavior of the XhtmlMobileTextWriter class. Device filtering is required in order to use a specific adapter or text writer for a server control. For more information about device filtering, see Architectural Overview of Adaptive Control Behavior and ASP.NET Device Filtering Overview.

This interface allows these objects to retrieve the path of their  boundary a segment at a time by using 1st through 3rd order Bézier curves,  which are lines and quadratic or cubic Bézier splines.  Multiple subpaths can be expressed by using a MOVETO segment to create a  discontinuity in the geometry to move from the end of one subpath to the  beginning of the next.  Each subpath can be closed manually by ending the last segment in the  subpath on the same coordinate as the beginning MOVETO segment for that  subpath or by using a CLOSE segment to append a line segment from the  last point back to the first. Be aware that manually closing an outline as  opposed to using a CLOSE segment to close the path might result in  different line style decorations being used at the end points of the  subpath. For example, the BasicStroke object uses a line JOIN decoration  to connect the first and last points if a CLOSE segment is encountered,  whereas simply ending the path on the same coordinate as the beginning  coordinate results in line CAP decorations being used at the ends.

The method itself is not an input. The descriptions get added for all Web methods belonging to a specified binding that produces a ServiceDescription. You can use a ServiceDescriptionto generate a Web Services Description Language (WSDL) document via the Write method. The ServiceDescriptionImporter class and related classes can also use a ServiceDescription to generate client proxy code or abstract server code. Use a class derived from the SoapExtensionReflector class in conjunction with a class derived from the abstract SoapExtension class to extend run-time processing of SOAP messages on the client or service. You can specify SoapExtensionReflectorin a configuration file via the <soapExtensionReflectorTypes> element and its child add element. You can also apply the configuration to an ASP.NET Web application that publishes a Web service. ThreadSafety: Any public static (Shared in Visual Basic) members of this type are thread safe.

838,34087,469884,473628,8,public class TableRowSorter<M extends TableModel>   ,"An implementation of RowSorter that provides sorting and filtering using a  TableModel. The following example shows adding sorting to a JTable:   TableModel myModel = createMyTableModel(); JTable table = new JTable(myModel); table.setRowSorter(new TableRowSorter(myModel));   This will do all the wiring such that when the user does the appropriate  gesture, such as clicking on the column header, the table will visually  sort.  JTable's row-based methods and JTable's selection model refer to the view  and not the underlying model. Therefore, it is necessary to convert between  the two. For example, to get the selection in terms of myModel you need to  convert the indices:   int[] selection = table.getSelectedRows(); for (int i = 0; i < selection.length; i++) { selection[i] = table.convertRowIndexToModel(selection[i]); }   Similarly to select a row in JTable based on a coordinate from the  underlying model do the inverse:   table.setRowSelectionInterval(table.convertRowIndexToView(row), table.convertRowIndexToView(row));   The previous example assumes you have not enabled filtering. If you have  enabled filtering convertRowIndexToView will return -1 for locations that  are not visible in the view.  TableRowSorter uses Comparators for doing comparisons. The following  defines how a Comparator is chosen for a column:     1. If a Comparator has been specified for the column by the        setComparator method, use it.    2. If the column class as returned by getColumnClass is String, use the        Comparator returned by Collator.getInstance().    3. If the column class implements Comparable, use a Comparator that       invokes the compareTo method.    4. If a TableStringConverter has been specified, use it to convert the       values to Strings and then use the Comparator returned by        Collator.getInstance().    5. Otherwise use the Comparator returned by Collator.getInstance() on       the results from calling toString on the objects.  In addition to sorting TableRowSorter provides the ability to filter. A  filter is specified using the setFilter method. The following example will  only show rows containing the string foo:   TableModel myModel = createMyTableModel(); TableRowSorter sorter = new TableRowSorter(myModel); sorter.setRowFilter(RowFilter.regexFilter(.*foo.*)); JTable table = new JTable(myModel); table.setRowSorter(sorter);   If the underlying model structure changes (the modelStructureChanged  method is invoked) the following are reset to their default values:  Comparators by column, current sort order, and whether each column is  sortable. The default sort order is natural (the same as the model), and  columns are sortable by default.  TableRowSorter has one formal type parameter: the type of the model.  Passing in a type that corresponds exactly to your model allows you to  filter based on your model without casting. Refer to the documentation of  RowFilter for an example of this.  WARNING: DefaultTableModel returns a column class of Object. As such all  comparisons will be done using toString. This may be unnecessarily  expensive. If the column only contains one type of value, such as an  Integer, you should override getColumnClass and return the appropriate  Class. This will dramatically increase the performance of this class.  Since:     1.6 See Also:     JTable, RowFilter, DefaultTableModel, Collator, Comparator",1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,4,478,clean

844,32196,438048,441792,8,public class MouseWheelEvent   ,"An event which indicates that the mouse wheel was rotated in a component.  A wheel mouse is a mouse which has a wheel in place of the middle button.  This wheel can be rotated towards or away from the user. Mouse wheels are  most often used for scrolling, though other uses are possible.  A MouseWheelEvent object is passed to every MouseWheelListener object which  registered to receive the interesting mouse events using the component's  addMouseWheelListener method. Each such listener object gets a MouseEvent  containing the mouse event.  Due to the mouse wheel's special relationship to scrolling Components,  MouseWheelEvents are delivered somewhat differently than other MouseEvents.  This is because while other MouseEvents usually affect a change on the  Component directly under the mouse cursor (for instance, when clicking a  button), MouseWheelEvents often have an effect away from the mouse cursor  (moving the wheel while over a Component inside a ScrollPane should scroll  one of the Scrollbars on the ScrollPane).  MouseWheelEvents start delivery from the Component underneath the mouse  cursor. If MouseWheelEvents are not enabled on the Component, the event is  delivered to the first ancestor Container with MouseWheelEvents enabled.  This will usually be a ScrollPane with wheel scrolling enabled. The source  Component and x,y coordinates will be relative to the event's final  destination (the ScrollPane). This allows a complex GUI to be installed  without modification into a ScrollPane, and for all MouseWheelEvents to be  delivered to the ScrollPane for scrolling.  Some AWT Components are implemented using native widgets which display  their own scrollbars and handle their own scrolling. The particular  Components for which this is true will vary from platform to platform. When  the mouse wheel is moved over one of these Components, the event is  delivered straight to the native widget, and not propagated to ancestors.  Platforms offer customization of the amount of scrolling that should take  place when the mouse wheel is moved. The two most common settings are to  scroll a certain number of units (commonly lines of text in a text-based  component) or an entire block (similar to page-up/page-down). The  MouseWheelEvent offers methods for conforming to the underlying platform  settings. These platform settings can be changed at any time by the user.  MouseWheelEvents reflect the most recent settings.

846,32745,450299,454043,8,public interface BlockingQueue<E>   ,"A Queue that additionally supports operations that wait for the queue to  become non-empty when retrieving an element, and wait for space to become  available in the queue when storing an element.  BlockingQueue methods come in four forms, with different ways of handling  operations that cannot be satisfied immediately, but may be satisfied at  some point in the future: one throws an exception, the second returns a  special value (either null or false, depending on the operation), the third  blocks the current thread indefinitely until the operation can succeed, and  the fourth blocks for only a given maximum time limit before giving up.  These methods are summarized in the following table:  Throws exception 	Special value 	Blocks 	Times out Insert 	add(e) 	offer(e) 	put(e) 	offer(e, time, unit) Remove 	remove() 	poll() 	take() 	poll(time, unit) Examine 	element() 	peek() 	not applicable 	not applicable  A BlockingQueue does not accept null elements. Implementations throw  NullPointerException on attempts to add, put or offer a null. A null is  used as a sentinel value to indicate failure of poll operations.  A BlockingQueue may be capacity bounded. At any given time it may have a  remainingCapacity beyond which no additional elements can be put without  blocking. A BlockingQueue without any intrinsic capacity constraints always  reports a remaining capacity of Integer.MAX_VALUE.  BlockingQueue implementations are designed to be used primarily for  producer-consumer queues, but additionally support the Collection  interface. So, for example, it is possible to remove an arbitrary element  from a queue using remove(x). However, such operations are in general not  performed very efficiently, and are intended for only occasional use, such  as when a queued message is cancelled.  BlockingQueue implementations are thread-safe. All queuing methods achieve  their effects atomically using internal locks or other forms of concurrency  control. However, the bulk Collection operations addAll, containsAll,  retainAll and removeAll are not necessarily performed atomically unless  specified otherwise in an implementation. So it is possible, for example,  for addAll(c) to fail (throwing an exception) after adding only some of the  elements in c.  A BlockingQueue does not intrinsically support any kind of close or  shutdown operation to indicate that no more items will be added. The  needs and usage of such features tend to be implementation-dependent. For  example, a common tactic is for producers to insert special end-of-stream  or poison objects, that are interpreted accordingly when taken by  consumers.  Usage example, based on a typical producer-consumer scenario. Note that a  BlockingQueue can safely be used with multiple producers and multiple  consumers.   class Producer implements Runnable { private final BlockingQueue queue; Producer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; } public void run() { try { while (true) { queue.put(produce()); } } catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...} } Object produce() { ... } }  class Consumer implements Runnable { private final BlockingQueue queue; Consumer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; } public void run() { try { while (true) { consume(queue.take()); } } catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...} } void consume(Object x) { ... } }  class Setup { void main() { BlockingQueue q = new SomeQueueImplementation(); Producer p = new Producer(q); Consumer c1 = new Consumer(q); Consumer c2 = new Consumer(q); new Thread(p).start(); new Thread(c1).start(); new Thread(c2).start(); } }   Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent collections, actions  in a thread prior to placing an object into a BlockingQueue happen-before  actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from the  BlockingQueue in another thread.

848,32662,448348,452092,8,public abstract class DateFormat   ,"DateFormat is an abstract class for date/time formatting subclasses which  formats and parses dates or time in a language-independent manner. The  date/time formatting subclass, such as SimpleDateFormat, allows for  formatting (i.e., date -> text), parsing (text -> date), and normalization.  The date is represented as a Date object or as the milliseconds since  January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.  DateFormat provides many class methods for obtaining default date/time  formatters based on the default or a given locale and a number of  formatting styles. The formatting styles include FULL, LONG, MEDIUM, and  SHORT. More detail and examples of using these styles are provided in the  method descriptions.  DateFormat helps you to format and parse dates for any locale. Your code  can be completely independent of the locale conventions for months, days of  the week, or even the calendar format: lunar vs. solar.  To format a date for the current Locale, use one of the static factory  methods:   myString = DateFormat.getDateInstance().format(myDate);   If you are formatting multiple dates, it is more efficient to get the  format and use it multiple times so that the system doesn't have to fetch  the information about the local language and country conventions multiple  times.   DateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateInstance(); for (int i = 0; i < myDate.length; ++i) { output.println(df.format(myDate[i]) + ; ); }   To format a date for a different Locale, specify it in the call to  getDateInstance().   DateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.LONG, Locale.FRANCE);   You can use a DateFormat to parse also.   myDate = df.parse(myString);   Use getDateInstance to get the normal date format for that country. There  are other static factory methods available. Use getTimeInstance to get the  time format for that country. Use getDateTimeInstance to get a date and  time format. You can pass in different options to these factory methods to  control the length of the result; from SHORT to MEDIUM to LONG to FULL. The  exact result depends on the locale, but generally:      * SHORT is completely numeric, such as 12.13.52 or 3:30pm     * MEDIUM is longer, such as Jan 12, 1952     * LONG is longer, such as January 12, 1952 or 3:30:32pm     * FULL is pretty completely specified, such as Tuesday, April 12, 1952       AD or 3:30:42pm PST.  You can also set the time zone on the format if you wish. If you want even  more control over the format or parsing, (or want to give your users more  control), you can try casting the DateFormat you get from the factory  methods to a SimpleDateFormat. This will work for the majority of  countries; just remember to put it in a try block in case you encounter an  unusual one.  You can also use forms of the parse and format methods with ParsePosition  and FieldPosition to allow you to      * progressively parse through pieces of a string.     * align any particular field, or find out where it is for selection on       the screen.   Synchronization  Date formats are not synchronized. It is recommended to create separate  format instances for each thread.

This parameter is not passed by all DrawImage overloads. You can test for its absence by checking for the value Zero. Return Value Type: System.Boolean This method returns true if it decides that the DrawImage method should prematurely stop execution. Otherwise it returns false to indicate that the DrawImage method should continue execution. Summary: Provides a callback method for deciding when the DrawImage method should prematurely cancel execution and stop drawing an image. Remarks: This method is used in conjunction with the DrawImage method of the Graphics class. Certain overloads of the DrawImage method call an application-defined callback method of this type to find out if the overloads should stop or continue execution. During execution, the relevant DrawImage overloads frequently call this callback method to find out if they should stop drawing the specified image or if they should continue drawing the image. The Graphics.DrawImageAbort callback method can determine whether to continue or not based on a chosen algorithm included in it, optionally using the data passed to it by the callbackdata parameter. For example, an algorithm might determine if the image has scrolled off the screen and signal a cancellation to the DrawImage method to stop drawing. A user declaration of this event-handling method must have the same parameters as the Graphics.DrawImageAbort delegate declaration. Example: This example is a simplistic implementation of the Graphics.DrawImageAbort delegate. It merely checks to see if the DrawImage method has passed it data using the callbackdata parameter. (Some DrawImage overloads have only a DrawImageAbort parameter and pass no data; some overloads have both DrawImageAbort and callbackdata parameters and can pass data.) If no data was passed, it returns true to signal to the calling DrawImage method that it should cancel the drawing. If data was passed, it returns false to signal that drawing should continue.

Items are listed in order of decreasing search  precedence:      * If the JavaServer Faces configuration file bundled into the WEB-INF        directory of the webapp contains a factory entry of the given factory       class name, that factory is used.      * If the JavaServer Faces configuration files named by the        javax.faces.CONFIG_FILES ServletContext init parameter contain any        factory entries of the given factory class name, those factories are       used, with the last one taking precedence.      * If there are any JavaServer Faces configuration files bundled into       the META-INF directory of any jars on the ServletContext's resource       paths, the factory entries of the given factory class name in those       files are used, with the last one taking precedence.      * If a META-INF/services/{factory-class-name} resource is visible to       the web application class loader for the calling application       (typically as a result of being present in the manifest of a JAR       file), its first line is read and assumed to be the name of the       factory implementation class to use.      * If none of the above steps yield a match, the JavaServer Faces       implementation specific class is used.  If any of the factories found on any of the steps above happen to have a  one-argument constructor, with argument the type being the abstract factory  class, that constructor is invoked, and the previous match is passed to the  constructor. For example, say the container vendor provided an  implementation of FacesContextFactory, and identified it in  META-INF/services/javax.faces.context.FacesContextFactory in a jar on the  webapp ClassLoader. Also say this implementation provided by the container  vendor had a one argument constructor that took a FacesContextFactory  instance. The FactoryFinder system would call that one-argument  constructor, passing the implementation of FacesContextFactory provided by  the JavaServer Faces implementation.  If a Factory implementation does not provide a proper one-argument  constructor, it must provide a zero-arguments constructor in order to be  successfully instantiated.  Once the name of the factory implementation class is located, the web  application class loader for the calling application is requested to load  this class, and a corresponding instance of the class will be created. A  side effect of this rule is that each web application will receive its own  instance of each factory class, whether the JavaServer Faces implementation  is included within the web application or is made visible through the  container's facilities for shared libraries.",1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,6,433,clean

890,32553,445904,449648,8,public interface DomainCombiner ,"A DomainCombiner provides a means to dynamically update the  ProtectionDomains associated with the current AccessControlContext.  A DomainCombiner is passed as a parameter to the appropriate constructor  for AccessControlContext. The newly constructed context is then passed to  the AccessController.doPrivileged(..., context) method to bind the provided  context (and associated DomainCombiner) with the current execution Thread.  Subsequent calls to AccessController.getContext or  AccessController.checkPermission cause the DomainCombiner.combine to get  invoked.  The combine method takes two arguments. The first argument represents an  array of ProtectionDomains from the current execution Thread, since the  most recent call to AccessController.doPrivileged. If no call to  doPrivileged was made, then the first argument will contain all the  ProtectionDomains from the current execution Thread. The second argument  represents an array of inherited ProtectionDomains, which may be null.  ProtectionDomains may be inherited from a parent Thread, or from a  privileged context. If no call to doPrivileged was made, then the second  argument will contain the ProtectionDomains inherited from the parent  Thread. If one or more calls to doPrivileged were made, and the most recent  call was to doPrivileged(action, context), then the second argument will  contain the ProtectionDomains from the privileged context. If the most  recent call was to doPrivileged(action), then there is no privileged  context, and the second argument will be null.  The combine method investigates the two input arrays of ProtectionDomains  and returns a single array containing the updated ProtectionDomains. In the  simplest case, the combine method merges the two stacks into one. In more  complex cases, the combine method returns a modified stack of  ProtectionDomains. The modification may have added new ProtectionDomains,  removed certain ProtectionDomains, or simply updated existing  ProtectionDomains. Re-ordering and other optimizations to the  ProtectionDomains are also permitted. Typically the combine method bases  its updates on the information encapsulated in the DomainCombiner.  After the AccessController.getContext method receives the combined stack of  ProtectionDomains back from the DomainCombiner, it returns a new  AccessControlContext that has both the combined ProtectionDomains as well  as the DomainCombiner.

A FilteredRowSet object consumes implementations of this interface  and enforces the constraints defined in the implementation of the method  evaluate. A FilteredRowSet object enforces the filter constraints in a  bi-directional manner: It outputs only rows that are within the constraints  of the filter; and conversely, it inserts, modifies, or updates only rows  that are within the constraints of the filter.   2.0 Implementation Guidelines  In order to supply a predicate for the FilteredRowSet. this interface must  be implemented. At this time, the JDBC RowSet Implementations (JSR-114)  does not specify any standard filters definitions. By specifying a standard  means and mechanism for a range of filters to be defined and deployed with  both the reference and vendor implementations of the FilteredRowSet  interface, this allows for a flexible and application motivated  implementations of Predicate to emerge.  A sample implementation would look something like this:    public class Range implements Predicate {  private Object lo[]; private Object hi[]; private int idx[];  public Range(Object[] lo, Object[] hi, int[] idx) { this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi; this.idx = idx; }  public boolean evaluate(RowSet rs) { CachedRowSet crs = (CachedRowSet)rs; boolean bool1,bool2;  // Check the present row determine if it lies // within the filtering criteria.  for (int i = 0; i < idx.length; i++) {  if ((rs.getObject(idx[i]) >= lo[i]) && (rs.getObject(idx[i]) >= hi[i]) { bool1 = true; // within filter constraints } else { bool2 = true; // outside of filter constraints } }  if (bool2) { return false; } else { return true; } }    The example above implements a simple range predicate.

The 'value' and 'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' fields are cleared. * =0 Then the value is always cached and always valid. The 'value' field is returned. If there is no'value' field then the getter method is invoked for the attribute. The 'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' field and `value' fields are set to the attribute's value and the current time stamp. * >0 Represents the number of seconds that the 'value' field is valid. The 'value' field is no longer valid when 'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' + 'currencyTimeLimit' > Now. o When 'value' is valid, 'value' is returned. o When 'value' is no longer valid then the getter method is invoked for the attribute. The 'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' field and `value' fields are updated.  Note: because of inconsistencies in previous versions of this specification, it is recommended not to use negative or zero values for currencyTimeLimit. To indicate that a cached value is never valid, omit the currencyTimeLimit field. To indicate that it is always valid, use a very large number for this field.  If the 'getMethod' field contains the name of a valid operation descriptor, then the method described by the operation descriptor is executed. The response from the method is returned as the value of the attribute. If the operation fails or the returned value is not compatible with the declared type of the attribute, an exception will be thrown.  If no 'getMethod' field is defined then the default value of the attribute is returned. If the returned value is not compatible with the declared type of the attribute, an exception will be thrown.  The declared type of the attribute is the String returned by MBeanAttributeInfo.getType(). A value is compatible with this type if one of the following is true:  * the value is null; * the declared name is a primitive type name (such as int) and the value is an instance of the corresponding wrapper type (such as java.lang.Integer); * the name of the value's class is identical to the declared name; * the declared name can be loaded by the value's class loader and produces a class to which the value can be assigned.

933,32236,438526,442270,8,public class AffineTransform   ,"The AffineTransform class represents a 2D affine transform that performs a  linear mapping from 2D coordinates to other 2D coordinates that preserves  the straightness and parallelness of lines. Affine transformations can  be constructed using sequences of translations, scales, flips, rotations,  and shears.  Such a coordinate transformation can be represented by a 3 row by 3 column  matrix with an implied last row of [ 0 0 1 ]. This matrix transforms source  coordinates (x,y) into destination coordinates (x',y') by considering them  to be a column vector and multiplying the coordinate vector by the matrix  according to the following process:   [ x']   [  m00  m01  m02  ] [ x ]   [ m00x + m01y + m02 ] [ y'] = [  m10  m11  m12  ] [ y ] = [ m10x + m11y + m12 ] [ 1 ]   [   0    0    1   ] [ 1 ]   [         1         ]    Handling 90-Degree Rotations  In some variations of the rotate methods in the AffineTransform class, a  double-precision argument specifies the angle of rotation in radians. These  methods have special handling for rotations of approximately 90 degrees  (including multiples such as 180, 270, and 360 degrees), so that the common  case of quadrant rotation is handled more efficiently. This special  handling can cause angles very close to multiples of 90 degrees to be  treated as if they were exact multiples of 90 degrees. For small multiples  of 90 degrees the range of angles treated as a quadrant rotation is  approximately 0.00000121 degrees wide. This section explains why such  special care is needed and how it is implemented.  Since 90 degrees is represented as PI/2 in radians, and since PI is a  transcendental (and therefore irrational) number, it is not possible to  exactly represent a multiple of 90 degrees as an exact double precision  value measured in radians. As a result it is theoretically impossible to  describe quadrant rotations (90, 180, 270 or 360 degrees) using these  values. Double precision floating point values can get very close to  non-zero multiples of PI/2 but never close enough for the sine or cosine to  be exactly 0.0, 1.0 or -1.0. The implementations of Math.sin() and  Math.cos() correspondingly never return 0.0 for any case other than  Math.sin(0.0). These same implementations do, however, return exactly 1.0  and -1.0 for some range of numbers around each multiple of 90 degrees since  the correct answer is so close to 1.0 or -1.0 that the double precision  significand cannot represent the difference as accurately as it can for  numbers that are near 0.0.  The net result of these issues is that if the Math.sin() and Math.cos()  methods are used to directly generate the values for the matrix  modifications during these radian-based rotation operations then the  resulting transform is never strictly classifiable as a quadrant rotation  even for a simple case like rotate(Math.PI/2.0), due to minor variations in  the matrix caused by the non-0.0 values obtained for the sine and cosine.  If these transforms are not classified as quadrant rotations then  subsequent code which attempts to optimize further operations based upon  the type of the transform will be relegated to its most general  implementation.  Because quadrant rotations are fairly common, this class should handle  these cases reasonably quickly, both in applying the rotations to the  transform and in applying the resulting transform to the coordinates. To  facilitate this optimal handling, the methods which take an angle of  rotation measured in radians attempt to detect angles that are intended to  be quadrant rotations and treat them as such. These methods therefore treat  an angle theta as a quadrant rotation if either Math.sin(theta) or  Math.cos(theta) returns exactly 1.0 or -1.0. As a rule of thumb, this  property holds true for a range of approximately 0.0000000211 radians (or  0.00000121 degrees) around small multiples of Math.PI/2.0.

942,32693,449942,453686,8,public final class ServiceLoader<S>   ,"A simple service-provider loading facility.  A service is a well-known set of interfaces and (usually abstract) classes.  A service provider is a specific implementation of a service. The classes  in a provider typically implement the interfaces and subclass the classes  defined in the service itself. Service providers can be installed in an  implementation of the Java platform in the form of extensions, that is, jar  files placed into any of the usual extension directories. Providers can  also be made available by adding them to the application's class path or by  some other platform-specific means.  For the purpose of loading, a service is represented by a single type, that  is, a single interface or abstract class. (A concrete class can be used,  but this is not recommended.) A provider of a given service contains one or  more concrete classes that extend this service type with data and code  specific to the provider. The provider class is typically not the entire  provider itself but rather a proxy which contains enough information to  decide whether the provider is able to satisfy a particular request  together with code that can create the actual provider on demand. The  details of provider classes tend to be highly service-specific; no single  class or interface could possibly unify them, so no such type is defined  here. The only requirement enforced by this facility is that provider  classes must have a zero-argument constructor so that they can be  instantiated during loading.  A service provider is identified by placing a provider-configuration file  in the resource directory META-INF/services. The file's name is the  fully-qualified binary name of the service's type. The file contains a list  of fully-qualified binary names of concrete provider classes, one per line.  Space and tab characters surrounding each name, as well as blank lines, are  ignored. The comment character is '\#' (' u0023', NUMBER SIGN); on each line  all characters following the first comment character are ignored. The file  must be encoded in UTF-8.  If a particular concrete provider class is named in more than one  configuration file, or is named in the same configuration file more than  once, then the duplicates are ignored. The configuration file naming a  particular provider need not be in the same jar file or other distribution  unit as the provider itself. The provider must be accessible from the same  class loader that was initially queried to locate the configuration file;  note that this is not necessarily the class loader from which the file was  actually loaded.  Providers are located and instantiated lazily, that is, on demand. A  service loader maintains a cache of the providers that have been loaded so  far. Each invocation of the iterator method returns an iterator that first  yields all of the elements of the cache, in instantiation order, and then  lazily locates and instantiates any remaining providers, adding each one to  the cache in turn. The cache can be cleared via the reload method.  Service loaders always execute in the security context of the caller.  Trusted system code should typically invoke the methods in this class, and  the methods of the iterators which they return, from within a privileged  security context.  Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent  threads.  Unless otherwise specified, passing a null argument to any method in this  class will cause a NullPointerException to be thrown.  Example Suppose we have a service type com.example.CodecSet which is  intended to represent sets of encoder/decoder pairs for some protocol. In  this case it is an abstract class with two abstract methods:       public abstract Encoder getEncoder(String encodingName); public abstract Decoder getDecoder(String encodingName);  Each method returns an appropriate object or null if the provider does not  support the given encoding. Typical providers support more than one  encoding.  If com.example.impl.StandardCodecs is an implementation of the CodecSet  service then its jar file also contains a file named       META-INF/services/com.example.CodecSet  This file contains the single line:       com.example.impl.StandardCodecs    \# Standard codecs  The CodecSet class creates and saves a single service instance at  initialization:       private static ServiceLoader<CodecSet> codecSetLoader = ServiceLoader.load(CodecSet.class);  To locate an encoder for a given encoding name it defines a static factory  method which iterates through the known and available providers, returning  only when it has located a suitable encoder or has run out of providers.       public static Encoder getEncoder(String encodingName) { for (CodecSet cp : codecSetLoader) { Encoder enc = cp.getEncoder(encodingName); if (enc != null) return enc; } return null; }  A getDecoder method is defined similarly.  Usage Note If the class path of a class loader that is used for provider  loading includes remote network URLs then those URLs will be dereferenced  in the process of searching for provider-configuration files.  This activity is normal, although it may cause puzzling entries to be  created in web-server logs. If a web server is not configured correctly,  however, then this activity may cause the provider-loading algorithm to  fail spuriously.  A web server should return an HTTP 404 (Not Found) response when a  requested resource does not exist. Sometimes, however, web servers are  erroneously configured to return an HTTP 200 (OK) response along with a  helpful HTML error page in such cases. This will cause a  ServiceConfigurationError to be thrown when this class attempts to parse  the HTML page as a provider-configuration file. The best solution to this  problem is to fix the misconfigured web server to return the correct  response code (HTTP 404) along with the HTML error page.

953,32774,451129,454873,8,public interface Condition ,"Condition factors out the Object monitor methods (wait, notify and  notifyAll) into distinct objects to give the effect of having multiple  wait-sets per object, by combining them with the use of arbitrary Lock  implementations. Where a Lock replaces the use of synchronized methods and  statements, a Condition replaces the use of the Object monitor methods.  Conditions (also known as condition queues or condition variables) provide  a means for one thread to suspend execution (to wait) until notified by  another thread that some state condition may now be true. Because access to  this shared state information occurs in different threads, it must be  protected, so a lock of some form is associated with the condition. The key  property that waiting for a condition provides is that it atomically  releases the associated lock and suspends the current thread, just like  Object.wait.  A Condition instance is intrinsically bound to a lock. To obtain a  Condition instance for a particular Lock instance use its newCondition()  method.  As an example, suppose we have a bounded buffer which supports put and  take methods. If a take is attempted on an empty buffer, then the thread  will block until an item becomes available; if a put is attempted on a full  buffer, then the thread will block until a space becomes available. We  would like to keep waiting put threads and take threads in separate  wait-sets so that we can use the optimization of only notifying a single  thread at a time when items or spaces become available in the buffer. This  can be achieved using two Condition instances.   class BoundedBuffer { final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock(); final Condition notFull  = lock.newCondition();  final Condition notEmpty = lock.newCondition();   final Object[] items = new Object[100]; int putptr, takeptr, count;  public void put(Object x) throws InterruptedException { lock.lock(); try { while (count == items.length) notFull.await(); items[putptr] = x; if (++putptr == items.length) putptr = 0; ++count; notEmpty.signal(); } finally { lock.unlock(); } }  public Object take() throws InterruptedException { lock.lock(); try { while (count == 0) notEmpty.await(); Object x = items[takeptr]; if (++takeptr == items.length) takeptr = 0; --count; notFull.signal(); return x; } finally { lock.unlock(); } } }   (The ArrayBlockingQueue class provides this functionality, so there is no  reason to implement this sample usage class.)  A Condition implementation can provide behavior and semantics that is  different from that of the Object monitor methods, such as guaranteed  ordering for notifications, or not requiring a lock to be held when  performing notifications. If an implementation provides such specialized  semantics then the implementation must document those semantics.  Note that Condition instances are just normal objects and can themselves be  used as the target in a synchronized statement, and can have their own  monitor wait and notification methods invoked. Acquiring the monitor lock  of a Condition instance, or using its monitor methods, has no specified  relationship with acquiring the Lock associated with that Condition or the  use of its waiting and signalling methods. It is recommended that to avoid  confusion you never use Condition instances in this way, except perhaps  within their own implementation.  Except where noted, passing a null value for any parameter will result in a  NullPointerException being thrown.   Implementation Considerations  When waiting upon a Condition, a spurious wakeup is permitted to occur,  in general, as a concession to the underlying platform semantics. This has  little practical impact on most application programs as a Condition should  always be waited upon in a loop, testing the state predicate that is being  waited for. An implementation is free to remove the possibility of spurious  wakeups but it is recommended that applications programmers always assume  that they can occur and so always wait in a loop.  The three forms of condition waiting (interruptible, non-interruptible, and  timed) may differ in their ease of implementation on some platforms and in  their performance characteristics. In particular, it may be difficult to  provide these features and maintain specific semantics such as ordering  guarantees. Further, the ability to interrupt the actual suspension of the  thread may not always be feasible to implement on all platforms.  Consequently, an implementation is not required to define exactly the same  guarantees or semantics for all three forms of waiting, nor is it required  to support interruption of the actual suspension of the thread.  An implementation is required to clearly document the semantics and  guarantees provided by each of the waiting methods, and when an  implementation does support interruption of thread suspension then it must  obey the interruption semantics as defined in this interface.  As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for interruption  are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding to an  interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be shown  that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked the  thread. An implementation should document this behavior.

As for the magnitude m: o If m is infinity, it is represented by the characters Infinity; thus, positive infinity produces the result Infinity and negative infinity produces the result -Infinity. o If m is zero, it is represented by the characters 0.0; thus, negative zero produces the result -0.0 and positive zero produces the result 0.0. o If m is greater than or equal to 10-3 but less than 107, then it is represented as the integer part of m, in decimal form with no leading zeroes, followed by '.'

Remarks: The RowErrorTextNeeded event occurs only when the DataGridView control DataSource property is set or its VirtualMode property is true. Handling the RowErrorTextNeeded event is useful when you want to determine the error for a row depending on its state and the values it contains. When you handle the RowErrorTextNeeded event and specify error text in the handler, an error glyph appears in the row header unless the DataGridView.ShowRowErrors property is set to false. When the user moves the mouse pointer over the error glyph, the error text appears in a ToolTip. The RowErrorTextNeeded event also occurs whenever the value of the DataGridViewRow.ErrorText property is retrieved. You can use the RowIndex property to determine the state or value of a row, and use this information to change or modify the ErrorText property. This property is initialized with the value of the row ErrorText property, which the event value overrides. Handle the RowErrorTextNeeded event when working with large amounts of data to avoid the performance penalties of setting the row ErrorText value for multiple rows. For more information, see Best Practices for Scaling the Windows Forms DataGridView Control. For more information about handling events, see Consuming Events. Example: The following code example demonstrates the use of this type. In the example, an event handler reports on the occurrence of the RowErrorTextNeeded event. This report helps you to learn when the event occurs and can assist you in debugging. To report on multiple events or on events that occur frequently, consider replacing Show with Console.WriteLine or appending the message to a multiline TextBox.

985,32775,451144,454888,8,public class LockSupport   ,"Basic thread blocking primitives for creating locks and other  synchronization classes.  This class associates, with each thread that uses it, a permit (in the  sense of the Semaphore class). A call to park will return immediately if  the permit is available, consuming it in the process; otherwise it may  block. A call to unpark makes the permit available, if it was not already  available. (Unlike with Semaphores though, permits do not accumulate. There  is at most one.)  Methods park and unpark provide efficient means of blocking and unblocking  threads that do not encounter the problems that cause the deprecated  methods Thread.suspend and Thread.resume to be unusable for such purposes:  Races between one thread invoking park and another thread trying to unpark  it will preserve liveness, due to the permit. Additionally, park will  return if the caller's thread was interrupted, and timeout versions are  supported. The park method may also return at any other time, for no  reason, so in general must be invoked within a loop that rechecks  conditions upon return. In this sense park serves as an optimization of a  busy wait that does not waste as much time spinning, but must be paired  with an unpark to be effective.  The three forms of park each also support a blocker object parameter. This  object is recorded while the thread is blocked to permit monitoring and  diagnostic tools to identify the reasons that threads are blocked. (Such  tools may access blockers using method getBlocker(java.lang.Thread).) The  use of these forms rather than the original forms without this parameter is  strongly encouraged. The normal argument to supply as a blocker within a  lock implementation is this.  These methods are designed to be used as tools for creating higher-level  synchronization utilities, and are not in themselves useful for most  concurrency control applications. The park method is designed for use only  in constructions of the form:  while (!canProceed()) { ... LockSupport.park(this); }  where neither canProceed nor any other actions prior to the call to park  entail locking or blocking. Because only one permit is associated with each  thread, any intermediary uses of park could interfere with its intended  effects.  Sample Usage. Here is a sketch of a first-in-first-out non-reentrant lock  class:  class FIFOMutex { private final AtomicBoolean locked = new AtomicBoolean(false); private final Queue<Thread> waiters = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<Thread>();  public void lock() { boolean wasInterrupted = false; Thread current = Thread.currentThread(); waiters.add(current);  // Block while not first in queue or cannot acquire lock while (waiters.peek() != current || !locked.compareAndSet(false, true)) { LockSupport.park(this); if (Thread.interrupted()) // ignore interrupts while waiting wasInterrupted = true; }  waiters.remove(); if (wasInterrupted)          // reassert interrupt status on exit current.interrupt(); }  public void unlock() { locked.set(false); LockSupport.unpark(waiters.peek()); } }",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,5,458,clean

(A Cancel button is a button control whose CommandName property is set to #Cancel#.) This enables you to perform a custom routine whenever this event occurs, such as stopping the cancel operation if it would put the item in an unwanted state. A ListViewCancelEventArgs object is passed to the event handler, which enables you to determine the index of the item. It also lets you indicate that the cancel operation should be stopped. To stop the operation, set the Cancel property of the ListViewCancelEventArgs object to true. For more information about how to handle events, see Consuming Events.

Remarks: The Legend class encapsulates all the functionality of the Chart control's legend, and is exposed using the Legends collection property of the root Chart object. There can be any number of legends for a chart image. Legends can: Be docked and aligned. Be displayed inside or outside the plotted chart areas. Automatically fit their contents. Use a predefined style, such as row, column or table. Use hatching, gradient colors and background images. Be sized and positioned anywhere within the chart image. Legend items are represented by the LegendItem object, and are either default or custom items. Custom items are not associated with data, and can be added, deleted and modified using the CustomItems property. Default items are by default automatically added to the legend, and are the names of the plotted data points for doughnut and pie charts. For all other chart types, the default items are the names of the plotted data series. Each series has a Legend property that defines the name of the legend that will be used. A legend item will not be created for a series if the IsVisibleInLegend property is set to false. The text for these default items can be changed using the LegendText property. This property will allow you to specify predefined keywords that will be replaced by their appropriate values at run-time. If you have a pie chart and you set the Label property, it will also set the legend text to the value you set for the labels. If you want to set the text to a different value, you can set the LegendText property. In most cases, you would want to set the LegendText property to #\#AXISLABEL# or #\#VALX#. Legend series symbols are rectangles, dots or lines. The symbol type is set automatically by the chart and depends on the plotted chart type. Legend text by default is automatically sized. You can disable automatic sizing of legend text by disabling the IsTextAutoFit property. When this property is set to false, the size of the legend text is determined by the Size property of the legend Font. If the IsTextAutoFit property is enabled, the AutoFitMinFontSize property determines the minimum font size that a legend item can have when resizing. The TextWrapThreshold property defines a limit on the number of characters that can be shown on one line before text is wrapped to another line. If you do not wish to wrap text in the legend, set the value of the TextWrapThreshold property to zero. By default, when the entire legend text does not fit in the legend, the text will be truncated. You can set the TextWrapThreshold on the legend to get the text to wrap instead of being truncated. If the contents of the legend cannot fit into the given space, legend entries are truncated. An ellipsis will be shown to indicate that there are more entries than the legend has space for. To prevent the legend items from being truncated,, set the position and size of the legend using the Position and Size properties, respectively. When setting the legend position or size, the chart can no longer automatically position the elements in the chart. In some cases, you many need to manually position other chart elements to achieve the desired appearance. Another option would be to define your own cell columns instead of using the default legend settings. The Legend object has a CellColumn Collection; each CellColumn object represents a column in the Legend. A cell column has MaximumWidth and MinimumWidth properties that can be used to adjust the size of the columns. When the legend contains many entries, InterlacedRows can be used to improve readability. When this property is set to True, it will display a back color that you can set using the InterlacedRowsColor property. By default, the legend is positioned in the top-right corner of the chart. This position can be modified by using the Docking and Alignment properties of the legend. The legend can also be associated with a chart area by use of the DockedToChartArea property. This property specifies the name of the chart area for which the legend should be docked. In addition, the IsDockedInsideChartArea property can be used to display the legend inside a chart area. When IsDockedInsideChartArea is set to False, the MaximumAutoSize property defines the maximum size, in percent, of the legend within the available chart when the legend is automatically positioned. This property should be set if you wish to adjust the width or height of the legend after the docking properties have been set. The legend can be modified using the CustomizeLegend event.

Remarks: The DataAdapter serves as a bridge between a DataSet and a data source for retrieving and saving data. The DataAdapter provides this bridge by mapping Fill, which changes the data in the DataSet to match the data in the data source, and Update, which changes the data in the data source to match the data in the DataSet. If you are connecting to a SQL Server database, you can increase overall performance by using the SqlDataAdapter along with its associated SqlCommand and SqlConnection objects.

Remarks: The ConstraintCollection is accessed through the DataTable.Constraints property. The ConstraintCollection can contain both UniqueConstraint and ForeignKeyConstraint objects for the DataTable. A UniqueConstraint object makes sure that data in a specific column is always unique to preserve the data integrity. The ForeignKeyConstraint determines what will occur in related tables when data in the DataTable is either updated or deleted. For example, if a row is deleted, the ForeignKeyConstraint will determine whether the related rows are also deleted (a cascade), or some other course of action. Note When you add a DataRelation that creates a relationship between two tables to a DataSet, both a ForeignKeyConstraint and a UniqueConstraint are created automatically. The UniqueConstraint is applied to the primary key column in the parent DataTable, and the constraint is added to that table's ConstraintCollection. The ForeignKeyConstraint is applied to the primary key column and the foreign key column, and the constraint is added to the child table's ConstraintCollection. The ConstraintCollection uses standard collection methods such as Add, Clear, and Remove. In addition, the Contains method can be used to look for the existence of a particular constraint in the collection. A UniqueConstraint is created when a DataColumn with its Unique property set to true is added to a DataTable object's DataColumnCollection. A ForeignKeyConstraint is created when a DataRelation is added to a DataSet object's DataRelationCollection. Example: The first example creates a DataTable, and adds a DataColumn (with its Unique property set to true) to the DataColumnCollection. The second example creates a DataSet, two DataTable objects, four columns, and a DataRelation. The count of constraints is then printed to show that a ForeignKeyConstraint and a UniqueConstraint are created when a DataRelation is added to the DataSet object's DataRelationCollection.

It allows an application to determine, before performing a  possibly unsafe or sensitive operation, what the operation is and whether  it is being attempted in a security context that allows the operation to be  performed. The application can allow or disallow the operation.  The SecurityManager class contains many methods with names that begin with  the word check. These methods are called by various methods in the Java  libraries before those methods perform certain potentially sensitive  operations. The invocation of such a check method typically looks like  this:       SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager(); if (security != null) { security.checkXXX(argument,  . . . ); }   The security manager is thereby given an opportunity to prevent completion  of the operation by throwing an exception. A security manager routine  simply returns if the operation is permitted, but throws a  SecurityException if the operation is not permitted. The only exception to  this convention is checkTopLevelWindow, which returns a boolean value.  The current security manager is set by the setSecurityManager method in  class System. The current security manager is obtained by the  getSecurityManager method.

Use it as a base class for writing your own custom encoder. Use this class if you want to implement a custom message encoder. To implement your own custom message encoder, you must provide custom implementations of the following abstract base classes: MessageEncodingBindingElement MessageEncoderFactory MessageEncoder Override the Encoder to return an instance of your custom MessageEncoder. Then wire up your custom MessageEncoderFactory to the binding element stack used to configure the service or client by overriding the CreateMessageEncoderFactory method to return an instance of this factory. The task of converting between the in-memory representation of a message and an XML Information Set (Infoset) representation that can be written to a stream is encapsulated within the MessageEncoder class, which most commonly serves as a factory for XML readers and XML writers that support specific types of XML encodings. The key methods on MessageEncoder are WriteMessage and ReadMessage. WriteMessage takes a Message object and writes it into a Stream object.

Remarks: An XsdSchemaFileEditor object is used at design time to select and edit a URL for an XML schema definition file (.xsd), and to assign the URL to a control property. Use the EditorAttribute attribute to associate the XsdSchemaFileEditor with a property. When the associated property is edited on the design surface, the designer host calls the EditValue method. The EditValue method uses the BuildUrl method, which in turn displays a user interface for selecting the URL, and then returns the URL that is selected by the user. The GetEditStyle method indicates the display style of the user interface. Derive a class from the XsdSchemaFileEditor to define a custom editor for an XML schema URL property. For example, a derived class can override the EditValue method, and then call the BuildUrl method with a custom Filter or Caption value. Example: The following code example demonstrates how to associate an instance of the XsdSchemaFileEditor class with a property that is contained within a custom control.

Remarks: The CurrencyManager derives from the BindingManagerBase class. Use the BindingContext to return either a CurrencyManager or a PropertyManager. The actual object returned depends on the data source and data member passed to the Item property of the BindingContext. If the data source is an object that can return only a single property (instead of a list of objects), the type will be a PropertyManager. For example, if you specify a TextBox as the data source, a PropertyManager will be returned. If, on the other hand, the data source is an object that implements the IList, IListSource, or IBindingList interface, a CurrencyManager will be returned. The Current property returns the current item in the underlying list. To change the current item, set the Position property to a new value. The value must be greater than 0 and must be less than the value of the Count property.

1085,34169,471815,475559,8,public class HTMLDocument.HTMLReader   ,"An HTML reader to load an HTML document with an HTML element structure.  This is a set of callbacks from the parser, implemented to create a set of  elements tagged with attributes. The parse builds up tokens (ElementSpec)  that describe the element subtree desired, and burst it into the document  under the protection of a write lock using the insert method on the  document outer class.  The reader can be configured by registering actions (of type  HTMLDocument.HTMLReader.TagAction) that describe how to handle the action.  The idea behind the actions provided is that the most natural text editing  operations can be provided if the element structure boils down to  paragraphs with runs of some kind of style in them. Some things are more  naturally specified structurally, so arbitrary structure should be allowed  above the paragraphs, but will need to be edited with structural actions.  The implication of this is that some of the HTML elements specified in the  stream being parsed will be collapsed into attributes, and in some cases  paragraphs will be synthesized. When HTML elements have been converted to  attributes, the attribute key will be of type HTML.Tag, and the value will  be of type AttributeSet so that no information is lost. This enables many  of the existing actions to work so that the user can type input, hit the  return key, backspace, delete, etc and have a reasonable result. Selections  can be created, and attributes applied or removed, etc. With this in mind,  the work done by the reader can be categorized into the following kinds of  tasks:  Block     Build the structure like it's specified in the stream. This produces     elements that contain other elements. Paragraph     Like block except that it's expected that the element will be used with     a paragraph view so a paragraph element won't need to be synthesized. Character     Contribute the element as an attribute that will start and stop at     arbitrary text locations. This will ultimately be mixed into a run of     text, with all of the currently flattened HTML character elements. Special     Produce an embedded graphical element. Form     Produce an element that is like the embedded graphical element, except     that it also has a component model associated with it. Hidden     Create an element that is hidden from view when the document is being     viewed read-only, and visible when the document is being edited. This     is useful to keep the model from losing information, and used to store     things like comments and unrecognized tags.

This class cannot be inherited. Remarks: Whenever the execution status of an activity changes, the workflow instance emits an activity status event to the runtime tracking infrastructure. The runtime tracking infrastructure can send the tracking service an ActivityTrackingRecord whenever an activity status event occurs. Usually, a tracking service is not interested in every activity status event that occurs in the workflow instance, but only in activity status events associated with certain kinds of activities at specified locations in the workflow instance. An ActivityTrackingLocation defines the matching parameters for such a location by specifying a reference activity type, a set of activity status change events, and a set of conditions that can more precisely qualify an instance or instances of the reference activity type. Note A single ActivityTrackingLocation may refer to more than one actual location in the potential execution path of a workflow instance. You add ActivityTrackingLocation objects to MatchingLocations and ExcludedLocations in order to define the match parameters for an ActivityTrackPoint in a TrackingProfile. You must specify the reference activity type to be matched by setting either ActivityTypeName or ActivityType. You may set MatchDerivedTypes to specify interest in activities derived from the reference activity type. You may add ActivityExecutionStatus values to ExecutionStatusEvents to specify the activity status events to be matched. You may add ActivityTrackingCondition objects to Conditions to specify interest in the reference activity type only for specific conditions. For example, you can specify interest in only a particular named instance of the reference activity type.

If you do not specify a value for the User property during the FormsAuthentication_OnAuthenticate event, the identity supplied by the forms authentication ticket in the cookie or URL is used. The FormsAuthentication_OnAuthenticate event is only raised when the authentication Mode is set to Forms and the FormsAuthenticationModule is an active HTTP module for the application.

1158,34701,479684,483428,8,public interface TypeInfo ,"The TypeInfo interface represents a type referenced from Element or Attr  nodes, specified in the schemas associated with the document. The type is a  pair of a namespace URI and name properties, and depends on the document's  schema.  If the document's schema is an XML DTD [XML 1.0], the values are computed  as follows:      * If this type is referenced from an Attr node, typeNamespace is        http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml and typeName represents the        [attribute type] property in the [XML Information Set] . If there is       no declaration for the attribute, typeNamespace and typeName are        null.     * If this type is referenced from an Element node, typeNamespace and        typeName are null.  If the document's schema is an XML Schema [XML Schema Part 1] , the values  are computed as follows using the post-schema-validation infoset  contributions (also called PSVI contributions):      * If the [validity] property exists AND is invalid or notKnown: the       {target namespace} and {name} properties of the declared type if       available, otherwise null.        Note: At the time of writing, the XML Schema specification does not       require exposing the declared type.

Remarks: The XmlDsigC14NTransform class represents the C14N XML canonicalization transform that describes the canonical form of an XML document. This transform allows a signer to create a digest (used to create a digital signature) using the canonical form of an XML document. A recipient can then verify the XML digital signature using the same canonical form of the XML document with the same transform. Use the XmlDsigC14NTransform class when you need to sign an XML document that does not contain comments. In most cases, a new instance of a canonicalization transform class is not required. To specify a canonicalization transform, pass the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that describes the transform to the CanonicalizationMethod property, which is accessible from the SignedInfo property. To acquire a reference to the canonicalization transform, use the CanonicalizationMethodObject property, which is accessible from the SignedInfo property. The URI that describes the XmlDsigC14NTransform class is defined by the XmlDsigC14NTransformUrl field and the XmlDsigCanonicalizationUrl field. You would only need to create a new instance of a canonicalization transform class for manually hashing an XML document or for using your own canonicalization algorithm. For more information about the C14N transform, see Sections 6.5 and 6.6.1 of the XMLDSIG specification, which is available from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/. The canonicalization algorithm is defined in the W3C Canonical XML specification, which is available at www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n. Note The HostProtectionAttribute attribute applied to this type or member has the following Resources property value: MayLeakOnAbort. The HostProtectionAttribute does not affect desktop applications (which are typically started by double-clicking an icon, typing a command, or entering a URL in a browser). For more information, see the HostProtectionAttribute class or SQL Server Programming and Host Protection Attributes. Example: This section contains two code examples.

For information about how to develop ASP.NET mobile applications, see the www.asp.net/mobile Web site. Remarks: This class is analogous to the <Choice> element. Choices are tested in the order that they appear within a <DeviceSpecific> element. If you specify the Filter property of the <Choice> element, its value must be the name of a device filter defined in the <deviceFilters> section of the Machine.config file. At run time, ASP.NET evaluates the specified device filter against the capabilities of the current device. If successful, the choice is selected. If you do not specify the Filter property, the defaults for the <Choice> element are selected. Example: The following code example shows a <Choice> element within an image. The Source attribute overrides the ImageUrl property of the Image control. Although the example uses functions to determine whether the browser requires WML (isWML11) or supports color (supportsColor), you can instead use a Web.config file to define a <DeviceSpecific> element that the .NET Framework automatically uses to make the determination for you.

The Synthesizer interface includes methods for loading and unloading  instruments from soundbanks. An instrument is a specification for  synthesizing a certain type of sound, whether that sound emulates a  traditional instrument or is some kind of sound effect or other imaginary  sound. A soundbank is a collection of instruments, organized by bank and  program number (via the instrument's Patch object). Different Synthesizer  classes might implement different sound-synthesis techniques, meaning that  some instruments and not others might be compatible with a given  synthesizer. Also, synthesizers may have a limited amount of memory for  instruments, meaning that not every soundbank and instrument can be used by  every synthesizer, even if the synthesis technique is compatible. To see  whether the instruments from a certain soundbank can be played by a given  synthesizer, invoke the isSoundbankSupported method of Synthesizer.  Loading an instrument means that that instrument becomes available for  synthesizing notes. The instrument is loaded into the bank and program  location specified by its Patch object. Loading does not necessarily mean  that subsequently played notes will immediately have the sound of this  newly loaded instrument. For the instrument to play notes, one of the  synthesizer's MidiChannel objects must receive (or have received) a  program-change message that causes that particular instrument's bank and  program number to be selected.

1218,32794,451524,455268,8,public class FileHandler   ,"Simple file logging Handler.  The FileHandler can either write to a specified file, or it can write to a  rotating set of files.  For a rotating set of files, as each file reaches a given size limit, it is  closed, rotated out, and a new file opened. Successively older files are  named by adding 0, 1, 2, etc into the base filename.  By default buffering is enabled in the IO libraries but each log record is  flushed out when it is complete.  By default the XMLFormatter class is used for formatting.  Configuration: By default each FileHandler is initialized using the  following LogManager configuration properties. If properties are not  defined (or have invalid values) then the specified default values are  used.      * java.util.logging.FileHandler.level specifies the default level for       the Handler (defaults to Level.ALL).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.filter specifies the name of a Filter        class to use (defaults to no Filter).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter specifies the name of a        Formatter class to use (defaults to java.util.logging.XMLFormatter)     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.encoding the name of the character set       encoding to use (defaults to the default platform encoding).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.limit specifies an approximate maximum       amount to write (in bytes) to any one file. If this is zero, then       there is no limit. (Defaults to no limit).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.count specifies how many output files       to cycle through (defaults to 1).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern specifies a pattern for       generating the output file name. See below for details. (Defaults to       %h/java%u.log).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.append specifies whether the       FileHandler should append onto any existing files (defaults to       false).  A pattern consists of a string that includes the following special  components that will be replaced at runtime:      * / the local pathname separator     * %t the system temporary directory     * %h the value of the user.home system property     * %g the generation number to distinguish rotated logs     * %u a unique number to resolve conflicts     * %% translates to a single percent sign % If no %g field has been specified and the file count is greater than one,  then the generation number will be added to the end of the generated  filename, after a dot.  Thus for example a pattern of %t/java%g.log with a count of 2 would  typically cause log files to be written on Solaris to /var/tmp/java0.log  and /var/tmp/java1.log whereas on Windows 95 they would be typically  written to C: TEMP java0.log and C: TEMP java1.log  Generation numbers follow the sequence 0, 1, 2, etc.  Normally the %u unique field is set to 0. However, if the FileHandler  tries to open the filename and finds the file is currently in use by  another process it will increment the unique number field and try again.  This will be repeated until FileHandler finds a file name that is not  currently in use. If there is a conflict and no %u field has been  specified, it will be added at the end of the filename after a dot. (This  will be after any automatically added generation number.)  Thus if three processes were all trying to log to fred%u.%g.txt then they  might end up using fred0.0.txt, fred1.0.txt, fred2.0.txt as the first file  in their rotating sequences.

Summary: Represents the method that will handle a CellContextMenuStripNeeded event of a DataGridView. Remarks: The CellContextMenuStripNeeded event occurs only when the DataGridView control DataSource property is set or its VirtualMode property is true. When you handle the CellContextMenuStripNeeded event, the shortcut menu that you specify in the handler is shown whenever the user right-clicks a cell. This is useful when you want to display shortcut menus determined by the current state or value of a cell. The CellContextMenuStripNeeded event also occurs whenever the value of the DataGridViewCell.ContextMenuStrip property is retrieved, either programmatically or when the user right-clicks the cell. You can use the ColumnIndex and RowIndex properties to determine the state or value of a cell, and use this information to set the ContextMenuStrip property. This property is initialized with the value of the cell ContextMenuStrip property, which the event value overrides. Handle the CellContextMenuStripNeeded event when working with large amounts of data to avoid the performance penalties of setting the cell ContextMenuStrip value for multiple cells. For more information, see Best Practices for Scaling the Windows Forms DataGridView Control. You can also specify shortcut menus for individual rows rather than individual cells by setting the row ContextMenuStrip property or handling the DataGridView control's RowContextMenuStripNeeded event. The cell ContextMenuStrip property setting overrides the row ContextMenuStrip property setting, and the CellContextMenuStripNeeded event overrides both the RowContextMenuStripNeeded event and the row ContextMenuStrip property setting. You can specify Nothing for a cell shortcut menu, however, to prevent a row shortcut menu from being overridden. For more information about handling events, see Consuming Events. When you create a DataGridViewCellContextMenuStripNeededEventHandler delegate, you identify the method that will handle the event. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The event handler is called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the delegate.

Remarks: Use this method to synchronize changes to the shared recognizer. For example, if you load or unload a speech recognition grammar while the recognizer is processing input, use this method and the RecognizerUpdateReached event to synchronize your application behavior with the state of the recognizer. When this method is called, the recognizer pauses or completes asynchronous operations and generates a RecognizerUpdateReached event. A RecognizerUpdateReached event handler can then modify the state of the recognizer in between recognition operations. When this method is called: If the recognizer is not processing input, the recognizer immediately generates the RecognizerUpdateReached event. If the recognizer is processing input that consists of silence or background noise, the recognizer pauses the recognition operation and generates the RecognizerUpdateReached event. If the recognizer is processing input that does not consist of silence or background noise, the recognizer completes the recognition operation and then generates the RecognizerUpdateReached event. While the recognizer is handling the RecognizerUpdateReached event: The recognizer does not process input, and the value of the RecognizerAudioPosition property remains the same. The recognizer continues to collect input, and the value of the AudioPosition property can change. To change whether the shared recognizer pauses recognition operations while an application is handling a SpeechRecognized event, use the PauseRecognizerOnRecognition property. Example: The following example shows a console application that loads and unloads Grammar objects. The application uses the RequestRecognizerUpdate method to request the speech recognition engine to pause so it can receive an update. The application then loads or unloads a Grammar object. At each update, a handler for RecognizerUpdateReached event writes the name and status of the currently loaded Grammar objects to the console.

The default is Guid.empty. Summary: Gets or sets the queue category. Remarks: The queue category allows an application to categorize its queues. For example, you can place all Billing queues in one category and all Order queues in another. The Category property provides access to the Message Queuing Type ID property (which is read/write), accessible through the Queue Properties dialog box in the Computer Management Console. You can define a new category. Although you can use NewGuid to create a category value that is unique across all Guid values, such an action is unnecessary. The category value needs to be distinct only from other categories, not from all other Guid values. For example, you can assign {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001} as the Category for one set of queues and {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002} as the Category for another set. It is not necessary to set the Category. The value can be Nothing. Setting this property modifies the Message Queuing queue. Therefore, any other MessageQueue instances are affected by the change.

Remarks: ToolboxItemContainer is a simple class that encapsulates a ToolboxItem for efficiency. By having a single class that is always loaded, you can defer the loading of the ToolboxItem until it is needed. Because new classes can be derived from ToolboxItem, you could load a ToolboxItem that could, in turn, load an assembly that is not already in memory. For a large collection of ToolboxItem objects, this could cause a large number of assemblies to be loaded, which decreases performance. Instead, the toolbox service deals only with ToolboxItemContainer objects and retrieves their contained ToolboxItem only when necessary. The ToolboxItemContainer is designed to hold any cached data from the ToolboxItem. The default implementation only holds the filter of the ToolboxItem, but deriving classes may choose to cache the name, image, and other information. ToolboxItemContainer objects support two forms of serialization: they can be serialized through standard runtime serialization, and they can also load and save themselves from a System.Windows.Forms.IDataObject.

A concrete implementation of the PKIXCertPathChecker class can be created  to extend the PKIX certification path validation algorithm. For example, an  implementation may check for and process a critical private extension of  each certificate in a certification path.  Instances of PKIXCertPathChecker are passed as parameters using the  setCertPathCheckers or addCertPathChecker methods of the PKIXParameters  and PKIXBuilderParameters class. Each of the PKIXCertPathCheckers check  methods will be called, in turn, for each certificate processed by a PKIX  CertPathValidator or CertPathBuilder implementation.  A PKIXCertPathChecker may be called multiple times on successive  certificates in a certification path. Concrete subclasses are expected to  maintain any internal state that may be necessary to check successive  certificates. The init method is used to initialize the internal state of  the checker so that the certificates of a new certification path may be  checked. A stateful implementation must override the clone method if  necessary in order to allow a PKIX CertPathBuilder to efficiently backtrack  and try other paths. In these situations, the CertPathBuilder is able to  restore prior path validation states by restoring the cloned  PKIXCertPathCheckers.  The order in which the certificates are presented to the  PKIXCertPathChecker may be either in the forward direction (from target to  most-trusted CA) or in the reverse direction (from most-trusted CA to  target). A PKIXCertPathChecker implementation must support reverse checking  (the ability to perform its checks when it is presented with certificates  in the reverse direction) and may support forward checking (the ability to  perform its checks when it is presented with certificates in the forward  direction). The isForwardCheckingSupported method indicates whether forward  checking is supported.  Additional input parameters required for executing the check may be  specified through constructors of concrete implementations of this class.  Concurrent Access  Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not  thread-safe.

The encapsulated method must correspond to the method signature that is defined by this delegate. This means that the encapsulated method must have nine parameters that are all passed to it by value, and it must not return a value. (In C\#, the method must return void. In Visual Basic, it must be defined by the Sub.End Sub construct. It can also be a method that returns a value that is ignored.) Typically, such a method is used to perform an operation. Note To reference a method that has nine parameters and returns a value, use the generic Func(Of T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, TResult) delegate instead.

The SoapFormatter class also supports RPCs with ISoapMessage objects, without using the IRemotingFormatter functionality. During RPCs, the IRemotingFormatter interface allows the specification of two separate object graphs: the graph of objects to serialize, and an additional graph that contains an array of header objects that convey information about the remote function call (for example, transaction ID or a method signature).

During deserialization of an RPC, a HeaderHandler delegate is specified to the Deserialize method of the formatter. The remoting infrastructure uses the HeaderHandler delegate to produce an object that supports the ISerializable interface. This object contains the information stored in the headers, and becomes the root of the graph returned by the deserializer. The SoapFormatter can also handle RPCs that are produced with objects that implement the ISoapMessage interface. To create an RPC without using the IRemotingFormatter functionality, place an object that supports the ISoapMessage interface at the root of a graph being serialized. To deserialize an RPC created in this manner the TopObject property must be set to another object that supports the ISoapMessage interface, and contains the relevant remote call information. TimeSpan Serialization TimeSpan objects are serialized according to the ISO 8601: 1998 section 5.5.3.2.1 #Alternative# standard. Version Information The SoapFormatter does not support serialization compatibility between versions of the .NET Framework. Serialization between versions 1.1 and 2.0 types in the Framework often fails. The following actions can be taken to remedy this issue: Convert to use the BinaryFormatter, which provides compatibility between 1.1 and 2.0. Convert existing persisted data to the new format. Convert all producers and consumers of serialized data to version 2.0. Avoid using types that changed from 1.1 to 2.0.

1367,38756,231699,234673,7,System.IO.Log.LogStore,"Additional online Documentation: Syntax: public sealed class LogStore : IDisposable Summary: Represents a log-structured storage. Remarks: The LogRecordSequence class provides an implementation of the record sequence interface on top of a Common Log File System (CLFS) log. It works with the LogStore class, which provides an interface for directly manipulating and managing a CLFS log file. A log store provides append-only storage across a set of disk extents. The LogStore class represents this storage, and provides methods for adding and removing containers, setting policy, and creating archives. It does not provide methods for reading from and writing to the storage; these methods are provided by the LogRecordSequence class. The relationship between the LogStore class and the LogRecordSequence class is similar to the relationship between a disk file and a FileStream object. The disk file provides the actual storage and has attributes such as length and last access time, while the FileStream object provides a view on the file that can be used to read from it and write to it. Similarly, the LogStore class has attributes like a policy and a collection of disk extents, and the LogRecordSequence class provides a record-oriented mechanism for reading and writing data. Unlike the file record sequence represented by the FileRecordSequence class, a LogStore instance stores its data in a collection of disk extents, represented by LogExtent instances. The extents in a given LogStore instance are all of uniform size, and space is added to and removed from a LogStore instance in extent increments. To add and remove log extents, use the Add and Remove methods of the LogExtentCollection object, which can be returned by the Extents property. A LogStore instance can have policies associated with it. These are represented by LogPolicy instances that can be returned by the Policy property. A policy dictates rules that the log will attempt to follow, such as maximum number of extents and minimum size, and instructions on growing or shrinking the LogStore under certain conditions. In addition, you can specify whether a LogStore instance can be archived. Policies are set per log and are volatile, which means that once every handle to the log is closed, the policy no longer exists. Example: The following example shows how to archive a LogStore to an XML document. ThreadSafety: Any public static (Shared in Visual Basic) members of this type are thread safe.

1368,38243,216109,219051,7,System.Data.OracleClient.OracleLob,"Additional online Documentation: Syntax: public sealed class OracleLob : Stream, ICloneable, IDisposable, INullable Summary: Represents a large object binary (LOB) data type stored on an Oracle server. This class cannot be inherited. Remarks: An OracleLob differs from an OracleBFile in that the data is stored on the server instead of in a physical file in the operating system. It can also be a read-write object, unlike an OracleBFile, which is always read-only. An OracleLob may be one of these OracleType data types. OracleType data type Description Blob An Oracle BLOB data type that contains binary data with a maximum size of 4 gigabytes (GB). This maps to an Array of type Byte. Clob An Oracle CLOB data type that contains character data, based on the default character set on the server, with a maximum size of 4 GB. This maps to String. NClob An Oracle NCLOB data type that contains character data, based on the national character set on the server with a maximum size of 4 GB. This maps to String. A .NET application developer can retrieve the Oracle LOB values into basic .NET data types, such as Array of type Byte and String, or the specialized OracleLob data type. The OracleLob class supports reading data from and writing to the Oracle LOB in the Oracle database. The following are the main characteristics of an OracleLob data type that distinguish it from basic .NET data types: After you retrieve the Oracle LOB value from the Oracle database into the OracleLob class, you can change the LOB data in an open transaction and your changes are directly reflected to the database. If you retrieve the Oracle LOB value into an Array of type Byte or String and update these arrays, your changes are not reflected to the database. When you use the OracleLob class to access a chunk of a LOB value, only that chunk is passed from the Oracle database to the client. When you use the GetChars method to access a chunk of a LOB value, the entire contents of the value are passed from the Oracle database to the client. To obtain an OracleLob object, call the GetOracleLob method. You can construct an OracleLob that is NULL using this format:  This technique is used primarily to test whether a LOB returned from the server is NULL, as this example illustrates:    A NULL LOB behaves similarly to a zero-byte LOB in that Read succeeds and always returns zero bytes. Selecting a LOB column that contains a null value returns Null. You must begin a transaction before obtaining a temporary LOB. Otherwise, the OracleDataReader may fail to obtain data later. You can also open a temporary LOB in Oracle by calling the DBMS_LOB.CREATETEMPORARY system stored procedure and binding a LOB output parameter. On the client side, a temporary LOB behaves like a table-based LOB. For example, to update the temporary LOB, it must be enclosed in a transaction. The following C\# example demonstrates how to open a temporary LOB.    Note The inherited WriteByte method fails if used with character data, and an InvalidOperationException is thrown. Use the Write method instead. Temporary LOBs are only closed when the connection is closed, but with pooling and under load, temporary LOBs do not close. This can be resolved by disposing the temporary LOB, by invoking tempLob.Dispose(). ThreadSafety: Any public static (Shared in Visual Basic) members of this type are thread safe.

Convolution using a convolution kernel is a spatial operation that computes  the output pixel from an input pixel by multiplying the kernel with the  surround of the input pixel. This allows the output pixel to be affected by  the immediate neighborhood in a way that can be mathematically specified  with a kernel.  This class operates with BufferedImage data in which color components are  premultiplied with the alpha component. If the Source BufferedImage has an  alpha component, and the color components are not premultiplied with the  alpha component, then the data are premultiplied before being convolved. If  the Destination has color components which are not premultiplied, then  alpha is divided out before storing into the Destination (if alpha is 0,  the color components are set to 0). If the Destination has no alpha  component, then the resulting alpha is discarded after first dividing it  out of the color components.  Rasters are treated as having no alpha channel. If the above treatment of  the alpha channel in BufferedImages is not desired, it may be avoided by  getting the Raster of a source BufferedImage and using the filter method of  this class which works with Rasters.

Remarks: The Route class enables you to specify how routing is processed in an ASP.NET application. You create a Route object for each URL pattern that you want to map to a class that can handle requests that correspond to that pattern. You then add the route to the Routes collection. When the application receives a request, ASP.NET routing iterates through the routes in the Routes collection to find the first route that matches the pattern of the URL. Set the Url property to a URL pattern. The URL pattern consists of segments that come after the application name in an HTTP request. For example, in the URL http://www.contoso.com/products/show/beverages, the pattern applies to products/show/beverages. A pattern with three segments, such as {controller}/{action}/{id}, matches the URL http://www.contoso.com/products/show/beverages. Each segment is delimited by the / character. When a segment is enclosed in braces ( { and } ), the segment is referred to a URL parameter. ASP.NET routing retrieves the value from the request and assigns it to the URL parameter. In the previous example, the URL parameter action is assigned the value show. If the segment is not enclosed in braces, the value is treated as a literal value. Set the Defaults property to a RouteValueDictionary object that includes values that are used if a parameter is missing from the URL or to set additional values that are not parameterized in the URL. Set the Constraints property to a RouteValueDictionary object that contains values that are either regular expressions or IRouteConstraint objects. These values are used to determine whether a parameter value is valid. Example: The following example shows how to create a Route object and add it to the Routes property.

A PKIX CertPathBuilder uses these parameters to build a CertPath which has  been validated according to the PKIX certification path validation  algorithm.  To instantiate a PKIXBuilderParameters object, an application must specify  one or more most-trusted CAs as defined by the PKIX certification path  validation algorithm. The most-trusted CA can be specified using one of two  constructors. An application can call PKIXBuilderParameters(Set,  CertSelector), specifying a Set of TrustAnchor objects, each of which  identifies a most-trusted CA. Alternatively, an application can call  PKIXBuilderParameters(KeyStore, CertSelector), specifying a KeyStore  instance containing trusted certificate entries, each of which will be  considered as a most-trusted CA.  In addition, an application must specify constraints on the target  certificate that the CertPathBuilder will attempt to build a path to. The  constraints are specified as a CertSelector object.

Remarks: The ConstraintCollection is accessed through the DataTable.Constraints property. The ConstraintCollection can contain both UniqueConstraint and ForeignKeyConstraint objects for the DataTable. A UniqueConstraint object makes sure that data in a specific column is always unique to preserve the data integrity. The ForeignKeyConstraint determines what will occur in related tables when data in the DataTable is either updated or deleted. For example, if a row is deleted, the ForeignKeyConstraint will determine whether the related rows are also deleted (a cascade), or some other course of action. Note When you add a DataRelation that creates a relationship between two tables to a DataSet, both a ForeignKeyConstraint and a UniqueConstraint are created automatically. The UniqueConstraint is applied to the primary key column in the parent DataTable, and the constraint is added to that table's ConstraintCollection. The ForeignKeyConstraint is applied to the primary key column and the foreign key column, and the constraint is added to the child table's ConstraintCollection. The ConstraintCollection uses standard collection methods such as Add, Clear, and Remove. In addition, the Contains method can be used to look for the existence of a particular constraint in the collection. A UniqueConstraint is created when a DataColumn with its Unique property set to true is added to a DataTable object's DataColumnCollection. A ForeignKeyConstraint is created when a DataRelation is added to a DataSet object's DataRelationCollection. Example: The first example creates a DataTable, and adds a DataColumn (with its Unique property set to true) to the DataColumnCollection. The second example creates a DataSet, two DataTable objects, four columns, and a DataRelation. The count of constraints is then printed to show that a ForeignKeyConstraint and a UniqueConstraint are created when a DataRelation is added to the DataSet object's DataRelationCollection.

Remarks: Each Windows Form has at least one BindingContext object that manages the BindingManagerBase objects for the form. Because the BindingManagerBase class is abstract, the return type of the Item property is either a CurrencyManager or a PropertyManager. If the data source is an object that can return only a single property (instead of a list of objects), the Type is a PropertyManager. For example, if you specify a TextBox as the data source, a PropertyManager is returned. On the other hand, if the data source is an object that implements IList or IBindingList, a CurrencyManager is returned. For each data source on a Windows Form, there is a single CurrencyManager or PropertyManager. Because there may be multiple data sources associated with a Windows Form, the BindingContext enables you to retrieve any particular CurrencyManager associated with a data source. Note When using the Item property, the BindingContext creates a new BindingManagerBase if one does not already exist. This can lead to some confusion, as the returned object may not manage the list (or any list) that you intend. To prevent returning an invalid BindingManagerBase, use the Contains method to determine if the intended BindingManagerBase already exists. If you use a container control, such as a GroupBox, Panel, or TabControl, to contain data-bound controls, you can create a BindingContext for just that container control and its controls. Then, each part of your form can be managed by its own BindingManagerBase. See the BindingContext constructor for more information about creating multiple BindingManagerBase objects for the same data source. If you add a TextBox control to a form and bind it to a column of a table in a dataset, the control communicates with the BindingContext of that form. The BindingContext, in turn, talks to the specific CurrencyManager for that data association. If you queried the Position property of the CurrencyManager, it would report the current record for the binding of that TextBox control. In the following code example, a TextBox control is bound to the FirstName column of a Customers table on the dataSet1 dataset through the BindingContext for the form it is on.  You can add a second TextBox control (TextBox2) to the form and bind it to the LastName column of the Customers table in the same dataset. The BindingContext is aware of the first binding (TextBox1 to Customers.FirstName), so it would use the same CurrencyManager, as both text boxes are bound to the same dataset (DataSet1).    If you bind TextBox2 to a different dataset, the BindingContext creates and manages a second CurrencyManager. It is important to be consistent about how you set the DataSource and DisplayMember properties; otherwise, the BindingContext creates multiple currency managers for the same dataset, which results in errors. The following code example shows a few ways to set the properties and their associated BindingContext objects. You can set the properties using either of the following methods, as long as you are consistent throughout your code.       Note Most Windows Forms applications bind through a BindingSource. The BindingSource component encapsulates a CurrencyManager and exposes the CurrencyManager programming interface. When using a BindingSource for binding, you should use the members exposed by the BindingSource to manipulate #currency# (that is, Position) rather than go through the BindingContext. Example: The following code example creates four Binding objects to bind five controls-a DateTimePicker and four TextBox controls-to several data sources. The BindingContext is then used to get the BindingManagerBase for each data source. ThreadSafety: Any public static (Shared in Visual Basic) members of this type are thread safe.

The default behavior (from the  Permission class) is to simply return null. Subclasses of class Permission  override the method if they need to store their permissions in a particular  PermissionCollection object in order to provide the correct semantics when  the PermissionCollection.implies method is called. If a non-null value is  returned, that PermissionCollection must be used. If null is returned, then  the caller of newPermissionCollection is free to store permissions of the  given type in any PermissionCollection they choose (one that uses a  Hashtable, one that uses a Vector, etc).  The PermissionCollection returned by the  Permission.newPermissionCollection method is a homogeneous collection,  which stores only Permission objects for a given Permission type. A  PermissionCollection may also be heterogeneous. For example, Permissions is  a PermissionCollection subclass that represents a collection of  PermissionCollections. That is, its members are each a homogeneous  PermissionCollection. For example, a Permissions object might have a  FilePermissionCollection for all the FilePermission objects, a  SocketPermissionCollection for all the SocketPermission objects, and so on.  Its add method adds a permission to the appropriate collection.  Whenever a permission is added to a heterogeneous PermissionCollection such  as Permissions, and the PermissionCollection doesn't yet contain a  PermissionCollection of the specified permission's type, the  PermissionCollection should call the newPermissionCollection method on the  permission's class to see if it requires a special PermissionCollection. If  newPermissionCollection returns null, the PermissionCollection is free to  store the permission in any type of PermissionCollection it desires (one  using a Hashtable, one using a Vector, etc.). For example, the Permissions  object uses a default PermissionCollection implementation that stores the  permission objects in a Hashtable.  Subclass implementations of PermissionCollection should assume that they  may be called simultaneously from multiple threads, and therefore should be  synchronized properly. Furthermore, Enumerations returned via the elements  method are not fail-fast. Modifications to a collection should not be  performed while enumerating over that collection.

The class object for a class  implementing the SQLData interface will be entered in the appropriate  Connection object's type map along with the SQL name of the UDT for which  it is a custom mapping.  Typically, a SQLData implementation will define a field for each attribute  of an SQL structured type or a single field for an SQL DISTINCT type. When  the UDT is retrieved from a data source with the ResultSet.getObject  method, it will be mapped as an instance of this class. A programmer can  operate on this class instance just as on any other object in the Java  programming language and then store any changes made to it by calling the  PreparedStatement.setObject method, which will map it back to the SQL type.  It is expected that the implementation of the class for a custom mapping  will be done by a tool.

The tool will use this information to implement  the SQLData.readSQL and SQLData.writeSQL methods. The readSQL method calls  the appropriate SQLInput methods to read each attribute from an SQLInput  object, and the writeSQL method calls SQLOutput methods to write each  attribute back to the data source via an SQLOutput object.

1512,33691,460076,463820,8,public abstract class BaseRowSet   ,"An abstract class providing a RowSet object with its basic functionality.  The basic functions include having properties and sending event  notifications, which all JavaBeansTM components must implement.   1.0 Overview  The BaseRowSet class provides the core functionality for all RowSet  implementations, and all standard implementations may use this class in  combination with one or more RowSet interfaces in order to provide a  standard vendor-specific implementation. To clarify, all implementations  must implement at least one of the RowSet interfaces (JdbcRowSet,  CachedRowSet, JoinRowSet, FilteredRowSet, or WebRowSet). This means that  any implementation that extends the BaseRowSet class must also implement  one of the RowSet interfaces.  The BaseRowSet class provides the following:      * Properties           o Fields for storing current properties           o Methods for getting and setting properties      * Event notification      * A complete set of setter methods for setting the parameters in a        RowSet object's command      * Streams           o Fields for storing stream instances           o Constants for indicating the type of a stream   2.0 Setting Properties  All rowsets maintain a set of properties, which will usually be set using a  tool. The number and kinds of properties a rowset has will vary, depending  on what the RowSet implementation does and how it gets its data. For  example, rowsets that get their data from a ResultSet object need to set  the properties that are required for making a database connection. If a  RowSet object uses the DriverManager facility to make a connection, it  needs to set a property for the JDBC URL that identifies the appropriate  driver, and it needs to set the properties that give the user name and  password. If, on the other hand, the rowset uses a DataSource object to  make the connection, which is the preferred method, it does not need to set  the property for the JDBC URL. Instead, it needs to set the property for  the logical name of the data source along with the properties for the user  name and password.  NOTE: In order to use a DataSource object for making a connection, the  DataSource object must have been registered with a naming service that uses  the Java Naming and Directory InterfaceTM (JNDI) API. This registration is  usually done by a person acting in the capacity of a system administrator.   3.0 Setting the Command and Its Parameters  When a rowset gets its data from a relational database, it executes a  command (a query) that produces a ResultSet object. This query is the  command that is set for the RowSet object's command property. The rowset  populates itself with data by reading the data from the ResultSet object  into itself. If the query contains placeholders for values to be set, the  BaseRowSet setter methods are used to set these values. All setter methods  allow these values to be set to null if required.  The following code fragment illustrates how the CachedRowSetTM object crs  might have its command property set. Note that if a tool is used to set  properties, this is the code that the tool would use.   crs.setCommand(SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS + WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > ? AND REGION = ?);   In this example, the values for CREDIT_LIMIT and REGION are placeholder  parameters, which are indicated with a question mark (?). The first  question mark is placeholder parameter number 1, the second question mark  is placeholder parameter number 2, and so on. Any placeholder parameters  must be set with values before the query can be executed. To set these  placeholder parameters, the BaseRowSet class provides a set of setter  methods, similar to those provided by the PreparedStatement interface, for  setting values of each data type. A RowSet object stores the parameter  values internally, and its execute method uses them internally to set  values for the placeholder parameters before it sends the command to the  DBMS to be executed.  The following code fragment demonstrates setting the two parameters in the  query from the previous example.   crs.setInt(1, 5000); crs.setString(2, West);   If the execute method is called at this point, the query sent to the DBMS  will be:   SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS + WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > 5000 AND REGION = 'West'   NOTE: Setting Array, Clob, Blob and Ref objects as a command parameter,  stores these values as SerialArray, SerialClob, SerialBlob and SerialRef  objects respectively.   4.0 Handling of Parameters Behind the Scenes  NOTE: The BaseRowSet class provides two kinds of setter methods, those that  set properties and those that set placeholder parameters. The setter  methods discussed in this section are those that set placeholder  parameters.  The placeholder parameters set with the BaseRowSet setter methods are  stored as objects in an internal Hashtable object. Primitives are stored as  their Object type. For example, byte is stored as Byte object, and int is  stored as an Integer object. When the method execute is called, the values  in the Hashtable object are substituted for the appropriate placeholder  parameters in the command. <P)> A call to the method getParams returns the  values stored in the Hashtable object as an array of Object instances. An  element in this array may be a simple Object instance or an array (which is  a type of Object). The particular setter method used determines whether an  element in this array is an Object or an array.  The majority of methods for setting placeholder parameters take two  parameters, with the first parameter indicating which placeholder parameter  is to be set, and the second parameter giving the value to be set. Methods  such as getInt, getString, getBoolean, and getLong fall into this category.  After these methods have been called, a call to the method getParams will  return an array with the values that have been set. Each element in the  array is an Object instance representing the values that have been set. The  order of these values in the array is determined by the int (the first  parameter) passed to the setter method. The values in the array are the  values (the second parameter) passed to the setter method. In other words,  the first element in the array is the value to be set for the first  placeholder parameter in the RowSet object's command. The second element is  the value to be set for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.  Several setter methods send the driver and DBMS information beyond the  value to be set. When the method getParams is called after one of these  setter methods has been used, the elements in the array will themselves be  arrays to accommodate the additional information. In this category, the  method setNull is a special case because one version takes only two  parameters (setNull(int parameterIndex, int SqlType)). Nevertheless, it  requires an array to contain the information that will be passed to the  driver and DBMS. The first element in this array is the value to be set,  which is null, and the second element is the int supplied for sqlType,  which indicates the type of SQL value that is being set to null. This  information is needed by some DBMSs and is therefore required in order to  ensure that applications are portable. The other version is intended to be  used when the value to be set to null is a user-defined type. It takes  three parameters (setNull(int parameterIndex, int sqlType, String typeName) ) and also requires an array to contain the information to be passed to the  driver and DBMS. The first two elements in this array are the same as for  the first version of setNull. The third element, typeName, gives the SQL  name of the user-defined type. As is true with the other setter methods,  the number of the placeholder parameter to be set is indicated by an  element's position in the array returned by getParams. So, for example, if  the parameter supplied to setNull is 2, the second element in the array  returned by getParams will be an array of two or three elements.  Some methods, such as setObject and setDate have versions that take more  than two parameters, with the extra parameters giving information to the  driver or the DBMS. For example, the methods setDate, setTime, and  setTimestamp can take a Calendar object as their third parameter. If the  DBMS does not store time zone information, the drivern uses the Calendar  object to construct the Date, Time, or Timestamp object being set. As is  true with other methods that provide additional information, the element in  the array returned by getParams is an array instead of a simple Object  instance.  The methods setAsciiStream, setBinaryStream, setCharacterStream, and  setUnicodeStream (which is deprecated, so applications should use  getCharacterStream instead) take three parameters, so for them, the element  in the array returned by getParams is also an array. What is different  about these setter methods is that in addition to the information provided  by parameters, the array contains one of the BaseRowSet constants  indicating the type of stream being set.  NOTE: The method getParams is called internally by RowSet implementations  extending this class; it is not normally called by an application  programmer directly.   5.0 Event Notification  The BaseRowSet class provides the event notification mechanism for rowsets.  It contains the field listeners, methods for adding and removing listeners,  and methods for notifying listeners of changes.  A listener is an object that has implemented the RowSetListener interface.  If it has been added to a RowSet object's list of listeners, it will be  notified when an event occurs on that RowSet object. Each listener's  implementation of the RowSetListener methods defines what that object will  do when it is notified that an event has occurred.  There are three possible events for a RowSet object:     1. the cursor moves    2. an individual row is changed (updated, deleted, or inserted)    3. the contents of the entire RowSet object are changed  The BaseRowSet method used for the notification indicates the type of event  that has occurred. For example, the method notifyRowChanged indicates that  a row has been updated, deleted, or inserted. Each of the notification  methods creates a RowSetEvent object, which is supplied to the listener in  order to identify the RowSet object on which the event occurred. What the  listener does with this information, which may be nothing, depends on how  it was implemented.   6.0 Default Behavior  A default BaseRowSet object is initialized with many starting values. The  following is true of a default RowSet instance that extends the BaseRowSet  class:     * Has a scrollable cursor and does not show changes made by others.     * Is updatable.     * Does not show rows that have been deleted.     * Has no time limit for how long a driver may take to execute the        RowSet object's command.     * Has no limit for the number of rows it may contain.     * Has no limit for the number of bytes a column may contain. NOTE: This       limit applies only to columns that hold values of the following       types: BINARY, VARBINARY, LONGVARBINARY, CHAR, VARCHAR, and        LONGVARCHAR.     * Will not see uncommitted data (make dirty reads).     * Has escape processing turned on.     * Has its connection's type map set to null.     * Has an empty Vector object for storing the values set for the       placeholder parameters in the RowSet object's command.  If other values are desired, an application must set the property values  explicitly. For example, the following line of code sets the maximum number  of rows for the CachedRowSet object crs to 500.   crs.setMaxRows(500);   Methods implemented in extensions of this BaseRowSet class must throw an  SQLException object for any violation of the defined assertions. Also, if  the extending class overrides and reimplements any BaseRowSet method and  encounters connectivity or underlying data source issues, that method may  in addition throw an SQLException object for that reason.

A persistence participant derives from the PersistenceParticipant class or the PersistenceIOParticipant class (derived class of the PersistenceParticipant class), implements abstract methods, and then add an instance of the class as a workflow instance extension. The WorkflowApplication and WorkflowServiceHost look for such extensions when persisting an instance and invoke appropriate methods at appropriate times. Remarks: A host executes the following steps (or stages) when persisting an instance: Collects values to be persisted. Maps fields of monolithic structured values to individual values. Issues the SaveWorkflowCommand to the persistence provider. Performs I/O under the persistence transaction. A host completes a stage before beginning the next stage. For example when persisting, the host collects values from all the persistence participants before moving to the second stage. In the second stage, the host provides all the values collected in the first stage to all persistence participants in the second stage for mapping. In the third stage, the host provides all the collected values in the first and second stages to the persistence provider when invoking the SaveWorkflowCommand. Then in the fourth stage, the host provides all the collected values to all the persistence IO participants under the persistence transaction. A host executes the following stages when loading a persistence instance: Issues the LoadWorkflowCommand and LoadWorkflowByInstanceKeyCommand to the persistence provider. Performs I/O under the persistence transaction. Publishes the loaded values. At the highest level, workflow instance extensions that derive from the PersistenceParticipant class can participate in the first (Collect) and second (Map) stages of persisting process and the third stage (Publish) of loading process. Workflow instance extensions deriving from the PersistenceIOParticipant class can additionally participate in the fourth stage of the persisting process and the second stage of the loading process (I/O).

Remarks: Concurrency control is a technique that data stores use to control how data is read and changed in the store when multiple clients are accessing and manipulating the same data. For example, one client reads data and presents it to a user, while another client reads the same data, and presents it to a different user. If both users update the data and submit it to the data storage, some unexpected result might occur, because the clients might update different values for the same data. This is considered a conflict. The ConflictDetection property that is defined for ASP.NET data source controls is used to determine how a control handles data conflicts in the underlying data storage when the underlying data storage is using optimistic concurrency and a delete or update operation is performed. By default, the ConflictDetection property is set to OverwriteChanges, which means the data source control will overwrite any changes made to a data row between the time the data source control first read data from the row and the time that the row is updated. The primary key is used for locating the data row that will be updated or deleted, but no other comparison of the data is performed. If the data source control is configured to use the CompareAllValues option, however, the control passes the original data in the oldValues collections of the Update and Delete methods so that you can write logic to update or delete data only if these values match the values currently in the data storage.

1550,32775,451144,454888,8,public class LockSupport   ,"Basic thread blocking primitives for creating locks and other  synchronization classes.  This class associates, with each thread that uses it, a permit (in the  sense of the Semaphore class). A call to park will return immediately if  the permit is available, consuming it in the process; otherwise it may  block. A call to unpark makes the permit available, if it was not already  available. (Unlike with Semaphores though, permits do not accumulate. There  is at most one.)  Methods park and unpark provide efficient means of blocking and unblocking  threads that do not encounter the problems that cause the deprecated  methods Thread.suspend and Thread.resume to be unusable for such purposes:  Races between one thread invoking park and another thread trying to unpark  it will preserve liveness, due to the permit. Additionally, park will  return if the caller's thread was interrupted, and timeout versions are  supported. The park method may also return at any other time, for no  reason, so in general must be invoked within a loop that rechecks  conditions upon return. In this sense park serves as an optimization of a  busy wait that does not waste as much time spinning, but must be paired  with an unpark to be effective.  The three forms of park each also support a blocker object parameter. This  object is recorded while the thread is blocked to permit monitoring and  diagnostic tools to identify the reasons that threads are blocked. (Such  tools may access blockers using method getBlocker(java.lang.Thread).) The  use of these forms rather than the original forms without this parameter is  strongly encouraged. The normal argument to supply as a blocker within a  lock implementation is this.  These methods are designed to be used as tools for creating higher-level  synchronization utilities, and are not in themselves useful for most  concurrency control applications. The park method is designed for use only  in constructions of the form:  while (!canProceed()) { ... LockSupport.park(this); }  where neither canProceed nor any other actions prior to the call to park  entail locking or blocking. Because only one permit is associated with each  thread, any intermediary uses of park could interfere with its intended  effects.  Sample Usage. Here is a sketch of a first-in-first-out non-reentrant lock  class:  class FIFOMutex { private final AtomicBoolean locked = new AtomicBoolean(false); private final Queue<Thread> waiters = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<Thread>();  public void lock() { boolean wasInterrupted = false; Thread current = Thread.currentThread(); waiters.add(current);  // Block while not first in queue or cannot acquire lock while (waiters.peek() != current || !locked.compareAndSet(false, true)) { LockSupport.park(this); if (Thread.interrupted()) // ignore interrupts while waiting wasInterrupted = true; }  waiters.remove(); if (wasInterrupted)          // reassert interrupt status on exit current.interrupt(); }  public void unlock() { locked.set(false); LockSupport.unpark(waiters.peek()); } }",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,5,458,clean

1553,32682,449099,452843,8,public interface Collection<E>   ,"The root interface in the collection hierarchy. A collection represents a  group of objects, known as its elements. Some collections allow duplicate  elements and others do not. Some are ordered and others unordered. The JDK  does not provide any direct implementations of this interface: it provides  implementations of more specific subinterfaces like Set and List. This  interface is typically used to pass collections around and manipulate them  where maximum generality is desired.  Bags or multisets (unordered collections that may contain duplicate  elements) should implement this interface directly.  All general-purpose Collection implementation classes (which typically  implement Collection indirectly through one of its subinterfaces) should  provide two standard constructors: a void (no arguments) constructor,  which creates an empty collection, and a constructor with a single argument  of type Collection, which creates a new collection with the same elements  as its argument. In effect, the latter constructor allows the user to copy  any collection, producing an equivalent collection of the desired  implementation type. There is no way to enforce this convention (as  interfaces cannot contain constructors) but all of the general-purpose  Collection implementations in the Java platform libraries comply.  The destructive methods contained in this interface, that is, the methods  that modify the collection on which they operate, are specified to throw  UnsupportedOperationException if this collection does not support the  operation. If this is the case, these methods may, but are not required to,  throw an UnsupportedOperationException if the invocation would have no  effect on the collection. For example, invoking the addAll(Collection)  method on an unmodifiable collection may, but is not required to, throw the  exception if the collection to be added is empty.  Some collection implementations have restrictions on the elements that they  may contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null elements, and  some have restrictions on the types of their elements. Attempting to add an  ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically  NullPointerException or ClassCastException. Attempting to query the  presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception, or it may simply  return false; some implementations will exhibit the former behavior and  some will exhibit the latter. More generally, attempting an operation on an  ineligible element whose completion would not result in the insertion of an  ineligible element into the collection may throw an exception or it may  succeed, at the option of the implementation. Such exceptions are marked as  optional in the specification for this interface.  It is up to each collection to determine its own synchronization policy. In  the absence of a stronger guarantee by the implementation, undefined  behavior may result from the invocation of any method on a collection that  is being mutated by another thread; this includes direct invocations,  passing the collection to a method that might perform invocations, and  using an existing iterator to examine the collection.  Many methods in Collections Framework interfaces are defined in terms of  the equals method. For example, the specification for the contains(Object  o) method says: returns true if and only if this collection contains at  least one element e such that (o==null ? e==null : o.equals(e)). This  specification should not be construed to imply that invoking  Collection.contains with a non-null argument o will cause o.equals(e) to be  invoked for any element e. Implementations are free to implement  optimizations whereby the equals invocation is avoided, for example, by  first comparing the hash codes of the two elements. (The Object.hashCode()  specification guarantees that two objects with unequal hash codes cannot be  equal.) More generally, implementations of the various Collections  Framework interfaces are free to take advantage of the specified behavior  of underlying Object methods wherever the implementor deems it appropriate.  This interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework.

1573,32774,451129,454873,8,public interface Condition ,"Condition factors out the Object monitor methods (wait, notify and  notifyAll) into distinct objects to give the effect of having multiple  wait-sets per object, by combining them with the use of arbitrary Lock  implementations. Where a Lock replaces the use of synchronized methods and  statements, a Condition replaces the use of the Object monitor methods.  Conditions (also known as condition queues or condition variables) provide  a means for one thread to suspend execution (to wait) until notified by  another thread that some state condition may now be true. Because access to  this shared state information occurs in different threads, it must be  protected, so a lock of some form is associated with the condition. The key  property that waiting for a condition provides is that it atomically  releases the associated lock and suspends the current thread, just like  Object.wait.  A Condition instance is intrinsically bound to a lock. To obtain a  Condition instance for a particular Lock instance use its newCondition()  method.  As an example, suppose we have a bounded buffer which supports put and  take methods. If a take is attempted on an empty buffer, then the thread  will block until an item becomes available; if a put is attempted on a full  buffer, then the thread will block until a space becomes available. We  would like to keep waiting put threads and take threads in separate  wait-sets so that we can use the optimization of only notifying a single  thread at a time when items or spaces become available in the buffer. This  can be achieved using two Condition instances.   class BoundedBuffer { final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock(); final Condition notFull  = lock.newCondition();  final Condition notEmpty = lock.newCondition();   final Object[] items = new Object[100]; int putptr, takeptr, count;  public void put(Object x) throws InterruptedException { lock.lock(); try { while (count == items.length) notFull.await(); items[putptr] = x; if (++putptr == items.length) putptr = 0; ++count; notEmpty.signal(); } finally { lock.unlock(); } }  public Object take() throws InterruptedException { lock.lock(); try { while (count == 0) notEmpty.await(); Object x = items[takeptr]; if (++takeptr == items.length) takeptr = 0; --count; notFull.signal(); return x; } finally { lock.unlock(); } } }   (The ArrayBlockingQueue class provides this functionality, so there is no  reason to implement this sample usage class.)  A Condition implementation can provide behavior and semantics that is  different from that of the Object monitor methods, such as guaranteed  ordering for notifications, or not requiring a lock to be held when  performing notifications. If an implementation provides such specialized  semantics then the implementation must document those semantics.  Note that Condition instances are just normal objects and can themselves be  used as the target in a synchronized statement, and can have their own  monitor wait and notification methods invoked. Acquiring the monitor lock  of a Condition instance, or using its monitor methods, has no specified  relationship with acquiring the Lock associated with that Condition or the  use of its waiting and signalling methods. It is recommended that to avoid  confusion you never use Condition instances in this way, except perhaps  within their own implementation.  Except where noted, passing a null value for any parameter will result in a  NullPointerException being thrown.   Implementation Considerations  When waiting upon a Condition, a spurious wakeup is permitted to occur,  in general, as a concession to the underlying platform semantics. This has  little practical impact on most application programs as a Condition should  always be waited upon in a loop, testing the state predicate that is being  waited for. An implementation is free to remove the possibility of spurious  wakeups but it is recommended that applications programmers always assume  that they can occur and so always wait in a loop.  The three forms of condition waiting (interruptible, non-interruptible, and  timed) may differ in their ease of implementation on some platforms and in  their performance characteristics. In particular, it may be difficult to  provide these features and maintain specific semantics such as ordering  guarantees. Further, the ability to interrupt the actual suspension of the  thread may not always be feasible to implement on all platforms.  Consequently, an implementation is not required to define exactly the same  guarantees or semantics for all three forms of waiting, nor is it required  to support interruption of the actual suspension of the thread.  An implementation is required to clearly document the semantics and  guarantees provided by each of the waiting methods, and when an  implementation does support interruption of thread suspension then it must  obey the interruption semantics as defined in this interface.  As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for interruption  are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding to an  interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be shown  that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked the  thread. An implementation should document this behavior.

1585,33350,456443,460187,8,public interface Context ,"This interface represents a naming context, which consists of a set of  name-to-object bindings. It contains methods for examining and updating  these bindings.   Names  Each name passed as an argument to a Context method is relative to that  context. The empty name is used to name the context itself. A name  parameter may never be null.  Most of the methods have overloaded versions with one taking a Name  parameter and one taking a String. These overloaded versions are equivalent  in that if the Name and String parameters are just different  representations of the same name, then the overloaded versions of the same  methods behave the same. In the method descriptions below, only one version  is fully documented. The second version instead has a link to the first:  the same documentation applies to both.  For systems that support federation, String name arguments to Context  methods are composite names. Name arguments that are instances of  CompositeName are treated as composite names, while Name arguments that are  not instances of CompositeName are treated as compound names (which might  be instances of CompoundName or other implementations of compound names).  This allows the results of NameParser.parse() to be used as arguments to  the Context methods. Prior to JNDI 1.2, all name arguments were treated as  composite names.  Furthermore, for systems that support federation, all names returned in a  NamingEnumeration from list() and listBindings() are composite names  represented as strings. See CompositeName for the string syntax of names.  For systems that do not support federation, the name arguments (in either  Name or String forms) and the names returned in NamingEnumeration may be  names in their own namespace rather than names in a composite namespace, at  the discretion of the service provider.   Exceptions  All the methods in this interface can throw a NamingException or any of its  subclasses. See NamingException and their subclasses for details on each  exception.   Concurrent Access  A Context instance is not guaranteed to be synchronized against concurrent  access by multiple threads. Threads that need to access a single Context  instance concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the  necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating a different Context  instance need not synchronize. Note that the lookup method, when passed an  empty name, will return a new Context instance representing the same naming  context.  For purposes of concurrency control, a Context operation that returns a  NamingEnumeration is not considered to have completed while the enumeration  is still in use, or while any referrals generated by that operation are  still being followed.   Parameters  A Name parameter passed to any method of the Context interface or one of  its subinterfaces will not be modified by the service provider. The service  provider may keep a reference to it for the duration of the operation,  including any enumeration of the method's results and the processing of any  referrals generated. The caller should not modify the object during this  time. A Name returned by any such method is owned by the caller. The caller  may subsequently modify it; the service provider may not.   Environment Properties  JNDI applications need a way to communicate various preferences and  properties that define the environment in which naming and directory  services are accessed. For example, a context might require specification  of security credentials in order to access the service. Another context  might require that server configuration information be supplied. These are  referred to as the environment of a context. The Context interface provides  methods for retrieving and updating this environment.  The environment is inherited from the parent context as context methods  proceed from one context to the next. Changes to the environment of one  context do not directly affect those of other contexts.  It is implementation-dependent when environment properties are used and/or  verified for validity. For example, some of the security-related properties  are used by service providers to log in to the directory. This login  process might occur at the time the context is created, or the first time a  method is invoked on the context. When, and whether this occurs at all, is  implementation-dependent. When environment properties are added or removed  from the context, verifying the validity of the changes is again  implementation-dependent. For example, verification of some properties  might occur at the time the change is made, or at the time the next  operation is performed on the context, or not at all.  Any object with a reference to a context may examine that context's  environment. Sensitive information such as clear-text passwords should not  be stored there unless the implementation is known to protect it.   Resource Files  To simplify the task of setting up the environment required by a JNDI  application, application components and service providers may be  distributed along with resource files. A JNDI resource file is a file in  the properties file format (see java.util.Properties), containing a list of  key/value pairs. The key is the name of the property (e.g.  java.naming.factory.object) and the value is a string in the format  defined for that property. Here is an example of a JNDI resource file:       java.naming.factory.object=com.sun.jndi.ldap.AttrsToCorba:com.wiz.from.Person java.naming.factory.state=com.sun.jndi.ldap.CorbaToAttrs:com.wiz.from.Person java.naming.factory.control=com.sun.jndi.ldap.ResponseControlFactory   The JNDI class library reads the resource files and makes the property  values freely available. Thus JNDI resource files should be considered to  be world readable, and sensitive information such as clear-text passwords  should not be stored there.  There are two kinds of JNDI resource files: provider and application.   Provider Resource Files  Each service provider has an optional resource that lists properties  specific to that provider. The name of this resource is:      [prefix/]jndiprovider.properties  where prefix is the package name of the provider's context  implementation(s), with each period (.) converted to a slash (/). For  example, suppose a service provider defines a context implementation with  class name com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtx. The provider resource for this  provider is named com/sun/jndi/ldap/jndiprovider.properties. If the class  is not in a package, the resource's name is simply jndiprovider.properties .  Certain methods in the JNDI class library make use of the standard JNDI  properties that specify lists of JNDI factories:      * java.naming.factory.object     * java.naming.factory.state     * java.naming.factory.control     * java.naming.factory.url.pkgs The JNDI library will consult the provider resource file when determining  the values of these properties. Properties other than these may be set in  the provider resource file at the discretion of the service provider. The  service provider's documentation should clearly state which properties are  allowed; other properties in the file will be ignored.   Application Resource Files  When an application is deployed, it will generally have several codebase  directories and JARs in its classpath. Similarly, when an applet is  deployed, it will have a codebase and archives specifying where to find the  applet's classes. JNDI locates (using ClassLoader.getResources()) all  application resource files named jndi.properties in the classpath. In  addition, if the file java.home/lib/jndi.properties exists and is readable,  JNDI treats it as an additional application resource file. (java.home  indicates the directory named by the java.home system property.) All of the  properties contained in these files are placed into the environment of the  initial context. This environment is then inherited by other contexts.  For each property found in more than one application resource file, JNDI  uses the first value found or, in a few cases where it makes sense to do  so, it concatenates all of the values (details are given below). For  example, if the java.naming.factory.object property is found in three  jndi.properties resource files, the list of object factories is a  concatenation of the property values from all three files. Using this  scheme, each deployable component is responsible for listing the factories  that it exports. JNDI automatically collects and uses all of these export  lists when searching for factory classes.   Search Algorithm for Properties  When JNDI constructs an initial context, the context's environment is  initialized with properties defined in the environment parameter passed to  the constructor, the system properties, the applet parameters, and the  application resource files. See InitialContext for details. This initial  environment is then inherited by other context instances.  When the JNDI class library needs to determine the value of a property, it  does so by merging the values from the following two sources, in order:     1. The environment of the context being operated on.    2. The provider resource file (jndiprovider.properties) for the context       being operated on. For each property found in both of these two sources, JNDI determines the  property's value as follows. If the property is one of the standard JNDI  properties that specify a list of JNDI factories (listed above), the values  are concatenated into a single colon-separated list. For other properties,  only the first value found is used.  When a service provider needs to determine the value of a property, it will  generally take that value directly from the environment. A service provider  may define provider-specific properties to be placed in its own provider  resource file. In that case it should merge values as described in the  previous paragraph.  In this way, each service provider developer can specify a list of  factories to use with that service provider. These can be modified by the  application resources specified by the deployer of the application or  applet, which in turn can be modified by the user.

1589,32774,451129,454873,8,public interface Condition ,"Condition factors out the Object monitor methods (wait, notify and  notifyAll) into distinct objects to give the effect of having multiple  wait-sets per object, by combining them with the use of arbitrary Lock  implementations. Where a Lock replaces the use of synchronized methods and  statements, a Condition replaces the use of the Object monitor methods.  Conditions (also known as condition queues or condition variables) provide  a means for one thread to suspend execution (to wait) until notified by  another thread that some state condition may now be true. Because access to  this shared state information occurs in different threads, it must be  protected, so a lock of some form is associated with the condition. The key  property that waiting for a condition provides is that it atomically  releases the associated lock and suspends the current thread, just like  Object.wait.  A Condition instance is intrinsically bound to a lock. To obtain a  Condition instance for a particular Lock instance use its newCondition()  method.  As an example, suppose we have a bounded buffer which supports put and  take methods. If a take is attempted on an empty buffer, then the thread  will block until an item becomes available; if a put is attempted on a full  buffer, then the thread will block until a space becomes available. We  would like to keep waiting put threads and take threads in separate  wait-sets so that we can use the optimization of only notifying a single  thread at a time when items or spaces become available in the buffer. This  can be achieved using two Condition instances.   class BoundedBuffer { final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock(); final Condition notFull  = lock.newCondition();  final Condition notEmpty = lock.newCondition();   final Object[] items = new Object[100]; int putptr, takeptr, count;  public void put(Object x) throws InterruptedException { lock.lock(); try { while (count == items.length) notFull.await(); items[putptr] = x; if (++putptr == items.length) putptr = 0; ++count; notEmpty.signal(); } finally { lock.unlock(); } }  public Object take() throws InterruptedException { lock.lock(); try { while (count == 0) notEmpty.await(); Object x = items[takeptr]; if (++takeptr == items.length) takeptr = 0; --count; notFull.signal(); return x; } finally { lock.unlock(); } } }   (The ArrayBlockingQueue class provides this functionality, so there is no  reason to implement this sample usage class.)  A Condition implementation can provide behavior and semantics that is  different from that of the Object monitor methods, such as guaranteed  ordering for notifications, or not requiring a lock to be held when  performing notifications. If an implementation provides such specialized  semantics then the implementation must document those semantics.  Note that Condition instances are just normal objects and can themselves be  used as the target in a synchronized statement, and can have their own  monitor wait and notification methods invoked. Acquiring the monitor lock  of a Condition instance, or using its monitor methods, has no specified  relationship with acquiring the Lock associated with that Condition or the  use of its waiting and signalling methods. It is recommended that to avoid  confusion you never use Condition instances in this way, except perhaps  within their own implementation.  Except where noted, passing a null value for any parameter will result in a  NullPointerException being thrown.   Implementation Considerations  When waiting upon a Condition, a spurious wakeup is permitted to occur,  in general, as a concession to the underlying platform semantics. This has  little practical impact on most application programs as a Condition should  always be waited upon in a loop, testing the state predicate that is being  waited for. An implementation is free to remove the possibility of spurious  wakeups but it is recommended that applications programmers always assume  that they can occur and so always wait in a loop.  The three forms of condition waiting (interruptible, non-interruptible, and  timed) may differ in their ease of implementation on some platforms and in  their performance characteristics. In particular, it may be difficult to  provide these features and maintain specific semantics such as ordering  guarantees. Further, the ability to interrupt the actual suspension of the  thread may not always be feasible to implement on all platforms.  Consequently, an implementation is not required to define exactly the same  guarantees or semantics for all three forms of waiting, nor is it required  to support interruption of the actual suspension of the thread.  An implementation is required to clearly document the semantics and  guarantees provided by each of the waiting methods, and when an  implementation does support interruption of thread suspension then it must  obey the interruption semantics as defined in this interface.  As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for interruption  are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding to an  interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be shown  that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked the  thread. An implementation should document this behavior.

Remarks: ASP.NET health monitoring allows production and operations staff to manage deployed Web applications. The System.Web.Management namespace contains the health event types responsible for packaging application health-status data and the provider types responsible for processing this data. It also contains supporting types that help during the management of health events. The WebSuccessAuditEvent class is used when a successful security-related operation occurs. An example of this is a successful URL authorization for a Web request. The following list describes the features for which events of type WebSuccessAuditEvent are raised by ASP.NET: File Authorization. Successful conditions are audited. File authorization is only attempted by ASP.NET when a Windows Identity is associated with the request. The related event audit code is AuditFileAuthorizationSuccess. URL Authorization. It signifies access of a URL resource for which authorization is granted. Successful conditions are audited. The related event audit code is AuditUrlAuthorizationSuccess. Other security conditions. The following is a list of the related event codes: AuditFormsAuthenticationSuccess AuditMembershipAuthenticationSuccess When a WebSuccessAuditEvent is raised, ASP.NET health monitoring increments the related Audit Success Events Raised performance counter and then checks the healthMonitoring configuration to determine whether any providers subscribe to the event. If providers subscribe to the event, ASP.NET dispatches the event to them for processing. Note To view the Audit Success Event Raised performance counter in System Monitor (PerfMon), in the Add Counters window select ASP.NET from the Performance object drop-down list, select the Audit Success Event Raised performance counter, and click the Add button. For more information, see Monitoring ASP.NET Application Performance. Because success audits represent an expected condition, you may not want to subscribe to them. You can subscribe to them in order to provide access auditing for the site. Note In most cases you will be able to use the ASP.NET health-monitoring types as implemented, and you will control the health-monitoring system by specifying values in the healthMonitoring configuration section. You can also derive from the health-monitoring types to create your own custom events and providers.

Remarks: The XmlDsigC14NWithCommentsTransform class represents the C14N XML canonicalization transform that describes the canonical form of an XML document. This transform allows a signer to create a digest using the canonical form of an XML document. A recipient can then verify the digital signature using the same canonical form of the XML document with the same transform. Use the XmlDsigC14NWithCommentsTransform class when you need to sign an XML document that contains comments. Note that you cannot directly create a new instance of a canonicalization transform class. To specify a canonicalization transform, pass the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that describes the transform to the CanonicalizationMethod property, which is accessible from the SignedInfo property. To acquire a reference to the canonicalization transform, use the CanonicalizationMethodObject property, which is accessible from the SignedInfo property. The URI that describes the XmlDsigExcC14NWithCommentsTransform class is defined by the XmlDsigExcC14NWithCommentsTransformUrl field. The URI that describes the XmlDsigC14NWithCommentsTransform class is defined by the XmlDsigC14NWithCommentsTransformUrl field and the XmlDsigCanonicalizationWithCommentsUrl field. For more information about the C14N with comments transform, see Sections 6.5 and 6.6.1 of the XMLDSIG specification, which is available from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/. The canonicalization algorithm is defined in the W3C Canonical XML specification, which is available at www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n. Note The HostProtectionAttribute attribute applied to this type or member has the following Resources property value: MayLeakOnAbort. The HostProtectionAttribute does not affect desktop applications (which are typically started by double-clicking an icon, typing a command, or entering a URL in a browser). For more information, see the HostProtectionAttribute class or SQL Server Programming and Host Protection Attributes. Example: This section contains two code examples. The first example demonstrates how to sign an XML file using a detached signature. This example creates a signature of www.microsoft.com in an XML file and then verifies the file. The second example demonstrates how to sign an XML file using an envelope signature. This example creates a signature of an XML file and then saves the signature in new XML file.

1613,32688,449630,453374,8,public final class Locale   ,"A Locale object represents a specific geographical, political, or cultural  region. An operation that requires a Locale to perform its task is called  locale-sensitive and uses the Locale to tailor information for the user.  For example, displaying a number is a locale-sensitive operation--the  number should be formatted according to the customs/conventions of the  user's native country, region, or culture.  Create a Locale object using the constructors in this class:       Locale(String language) Locale(String language, String country) Locale(String language, String country, String variant)   The language argument is a valid ISO Language Code. These codes are the  lower-case, two-letter codes as defined by ISO-639. You can find a full  list of these codes at a number of sites, such as: http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/englangn.html  The country argument is a valid ISO Country Code. These codes are the  upper-case, two-letter codes as defined by ISO-3166. You can find a full  list of these codes at a number of sites, such as: http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html  The variant argument is a vendor or browser-specific code. For example, use  WIN for Windows, MAC for Macintosh, and POSIX for POSIX. Where there are  two variants, separate them with an underscore, and put the most important  one first. For example, a Traditional Spanish collation might construct a  locale with parameters for language, country and variant as: es, ES,  Traditional_WIN.  Because a Locale object is just an identifier for a region, no validity  check is performed when you construct a Locale. If you want to see whether  particular resources are available for the Locale you construct, you must  query those resources. For example, ask the NumberFormat for the locales it  supports using its getAvailableLocales method. Note: When you ask for a resource for a particular locale, you get back the  best available match, not necessarily precisely what you asked for. For  more information, look at ResourceBundle.  The Locale class provides a number of convenient constants that you can use  to create Locale objects for commonly used locales. For example, the  following creates a Locale object for the United States:       Locale.US   Once you've created a Locale you can query it for information about itself.  Use getCountry to get the ISO Country Code and getLanguage to get the ISO  Language Code. You can use getDisplayCountry to get the name of the country  suitable for displaying to the user. Similarly, you can use  getDisplayLanguage to get the name of the language suitable for displaying  to the user. Interestingly, the getDisplayXXX methods are themselves  locale-sensitive and have two versions: one that uses the default locale  and one that uses the locale specified as an argument.  The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform  locale-sensitive operations. For example, the NumberFormat class formats  numbers, currency, or percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes  such as NumberFormat have a number of convenience methods for creating a  default object of that type. For example, the NumberFormat class provides  these three convenience methods for creating a default NumberFormat  object:       NumberFormat.getInstance() NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance() NumberFormat.getPercentInstance()   These methods have two variants; one with an explicit locale and one  without; the latter using the default locale.       NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale) NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale) NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale)   A Locale is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object (NumberFormat ) that you would like to get. The locale is just a mechanism for  identifying objects, not a container for the objects themselves.

This class cannot be inherited. Remarks: For a list of predefined formats to use with the Clipboard class, see the DataFormats class. Call SetDataObject to put data on the Clipboard, replacing its current contents. To place a persistent copy of the data on the Clipboard, set the copy parameter to true. Note To place data on the Clipboard in multiple formats, use the DataObject class or an IDataObject implementation. Place data on the Clipboard in multiple formats to maximize the possibility that a target application, whose format requirements you might not know, can successfully retrieve the data. Call GetDataObject to retrieve data from the Clipboard. The data is returned as an object that implements the IDataObject interface. Use the methods specified by IDataObject and fields in DataFormats to extract the data from the object. If you do not know the format of the data you retrieved, call the GetFormats method of the IDataObject interface to get a list of all formats that data is stored in. Then call the GetData method of the IDataObject interface, and specify a format that your application can use. In .NET Framework version 2.0, the Clipboard class provides additional methods that make it easier to work with the system Clipboard. Call the Clear method to remove all data from the Clipboard. To add data of a particular format to the Clipboard, replacing the existing data, call the appropriate SetFormat method, such as SetText, or call the SetData method to specify the format. To retrieve data of a particular format from the Clipboard, first call the appropriate ContainsFormat method (such as ContainsText) method to determine whether the Clipboard contains data in that format, and then call the appropriate GetFormat method (such as GetText) to retrieve the data if the Clipboard contains it. To specify the format in these operations, call the ContainsData and GetData methods instead. Note All Windows-based applications share the system Clipboard, so the contents are subject to change when you switch to another application. An object must be serializable for it to be put on the Clipboard. If you pass a non-serializable object to a Clipboard method, the method will fail without throwing an exception. See System.Runtime.Serialization for more information on serialization. If your target application requires a very specific data format, the headers added to the data in the serialization process may prevent the application from recognizing your data. To preserve your data format, add your data as a Byte array to a MemoryStream and pass the MemoryStream to the SetData method. The Clipboard class can only be used in threads set to single thread apartment (STA) mode. To use this class, ensure that your Main method is marked with the STAThreadAttribute attribute. Special considerations may be necessary when using the metafile format with the Clipboard. Due to a limitation in the current implementation of the DataObject class, the metafile format used by the .NET Framework may not be recognized by applications that use an older metafile format. In this case, you must interoperate with the Win32 Clipboard application programming interfaces (APIs). For more information, see article 323530, #Metafiles on Clipboard Are Not Visible to All Applications,# in the Microsoft Knowledge Base at http://support.microsoft.com. Example: The following code example uses Clipboard methods to place data on and retrieve it from the system Clipboard. This code assumes button1, button2, textBox1, and textBox2 have been created and placed on the form. The button1_Click method calls SetDataObject to take selected text from the text box and place it on the system Clipboard. The button2_Click method calls GetDataObject to retrieve data from the system Clipboard. The code uses IDataObject and DataFormats to extract the data returned and displays the data in textBox2.

Remarks: The ISessionIDManager interface identifies the methods that you must implement to create a custom manager for session-identifier values. An ISessionIDManager interface implementation creates and validates session-identifier values, and manages the storage of a session identifier in the HTTP response as well as the retrieval of a session-identifier value from the HTTP request. You enable the custom session-ID manager using the sessionIDManagerType attribute of the sessionState Element (ASP.NET Settings Schema) configuration element. If your ISessionIDManager interface implementation will support cookieless session identifiers, you will need to implement a solution for sending and retrieving session identifiers in the URL, such as an ISAPI filter. If you only want to supply custom session-identifier values to be used by ASP.NET session state, you can create a class that inherits the SessionIDManager class and override only the CreateSessionID and Validate methods with your own custom implementation. This enables you to supply your own session-identifier values, while relying on the base SessionIDManager class to store values to the HTTP response and retrieve values from the HTTP request. For an example of overriding the SessionIDManager class and implementing these methods, see the example provided for the CreateSessionID method of the SessionIDManager class.

The measure of size is universally shared by all algorithm       parameters, though it is interpreted differently for different       algorithms. For example, in the case of parameters for the DSA        algorithm, size corresponds to the size of the prime modulus (in       bits). When using this approach, algorithm-specific parameter       generation values - if any - default to some standard values, unless       they can be derived from the specified size.      * The other approach initializes a parameter generator object using       algorithm-specific semantics, which are represented by a set of       algorithm-specific parameter generation values. To generate       Diffie-Hellman system parameters, for example, the parameter       generation values usually consist of the size of the prime modulus       and the size of the random exponent, both specified in number of       bits.  In case the client does not explicitly initialize the  AlgorithmParameterGenerator (via a call to an init method), each provider  must supply (and document) a default initialization.

Remarks: The ControlDesigner class provides a base control designer class that can be inherited from and extended to provide design-time support for a Web server control in a design host, such as Visual Studio 2005. The object model for working with design-time rendering is improved over earlier versions, with the following new base classes to provide access to the simplified object model: ControlDesigner , which is not new, but has been greatly improved. ContainerControlDesigner . CompositeControlDesigner . Automatic Formatting You can create a variety of automatic and pre-defined formats that can simplify the process of page developers who are applying complex style changes to custom Web server controls. For example, the TableDesigner control, which derives from the ControlDesigner class, provides many automatic formats from which to choose. To implement and provide automatic formatting in your custom controls, use the following features: The AutoFormats property. The OnAutoFormatApplied method. The DesignerAutoFormat class. The DesignerAutoFormatStyle class. Action Lists (Smart Tags) Action lists are menus of important or widely used tasks that a page developer who uses a control can perform in a design-time user interface (UI), such as Visual Studio 2005. For example, the design-time view of your control could provide a menu of available tasks. This includes a task to format the control automatically. To learn about action lists, start with the following features: The ActionLists property. The DesignerActionList class. The GetSortedActionItems method. The DesignerActionListCollection class. The DesignerActionMethodItem class. The DesignerActionPropertyItem class. Control Designer Regions Regions are editable areas in the design-time view of a Web server control. This feature offers WYSIWYG-like editing of the template content, inner controls, and properties at design time. You can have the control designer create controls in regions or you can use the Toolbox to drag and drop controls into regions. Regions are managed with the following features: The OnClick method. The DesignerRegion class. The EditableDesignerRegion class. The GetEditableDesignerRegionContent method. The SetEditableDesignerRegionContent method. Templates The model for creating a UI for design-time editing of templated controls, such as the GridView control, has been greatly improved from earlier versions. You can create complex custom controls that include templates for various parts of the control, and your custom control designer can help page developers who are modifying templates with the following features: The TemplateGroups property. The InTemplateMode property. The TemplateGroup class. Design-Time Rendering The ControlDesigner class has the following methods to support design-time rendering of the Web server control. Most of these methods are the same as in earlier versions: The GetDesignTimeHtml method. The GetEmptyDesignTimeHtml method. The GetErrorDesignTimeHtml method. The UpdateDesignTimeHtml method. The CreatePlaceHolderDesignTimeHtml method. Example: The following code example demonstrates how to create a simple designer class that derives from the ControlDesigner class. This control designer supports a custom TextControl class and provides a command to change the text size of a control at design time. The control designer is associated with the control by specifying the control designer in a DesignerAttribute object declaration on the TextControl class. The key to persisting property changes from the control designer to the HTML markup is found in the ToggleTextSize method of the custom ActionList class.

These chart types require more than one Y-value because one data point consists of multiple values. For example, to plot one stock chart column, four values are required: high, low, open and close values. This property returns an array of double values when used to retrieve multiple Y-values. Important The YValuesPerPoint property determines the maximum number of Y-values that all data points in a Series can have. If you specify more than the allowable number of Y-values, an exception will be raised.

1712,33567,459037,462781,8,public abstract class Configuration   ,"A Configuration object is responsible for specifying which LoginModules  should be used for a particular application, and in what order the  LoginModules should be invoked.  A login configuration contains the following information. Note that this  example only represents the default syntax for the Configuration. Subclass  implementations of this class may implement alternative syntaxes and may  retrieve the Configuration from any source such as files, databases, or  servers.   Name { ModuleClass  Flag    ModuleOptions; ModuleClass  Flag    ModuleOptions; ModuleClass  Flag    ModuleOptions; }; Name { ModuleClass  Flag    ModuleOptions; ModuleClass  Flag    ModuleOptions; }; other { ModuleClass  Flag    ModuleOptions; ModuleClass  Flag    ModuleOptions; };   Each entry in the Configuration is indexed via an application name, Name,  and contains a list of LoginModules configured for that application. Each  LoginModule is specified via its fully qualified class name. Authentication  proceeds down the module list in the exact order specified. If an  application does not have specific entry, it defaults to the specific entry  for other.  The Flag value controls the overall behavior as authentication proceeds  down the stack. The following represents a description of the valid values  for Flag and their respective semantics:   1) Required     - The LoginModule is required to succeed. If it succeeds or fails, authentication still continues to proceed down the LoginModule list.  2) Requisite    - The LoginModule is required to succeed. If it succeeds, authentication continues down the LoginModule list.  If it fails, control immediately returns to the application (authentication does not proceed down the LoginModule list).  3) Sufficient   - The LoginModule is not required to succeed.  If it does succeed, control immediately returns to the application (authentication does not proceed down the LoginModule list). If it fails, authentication continues down the LoginModule list.  4) Optional     - The LoginModule is not required to succeed.  If it succeeds or fails, authentication still continues to proceed down the LoginModule list.   The overall authentication succeeds only if all Required and Requisite  LoginModules succeed. If a Sufficient LoginModule is configured and  succeeds, then only the Required and Requisite LoginModules prior to that  Sufficient LoginModule need to have succeeded for the overall  authentication to succeed. If no Required or Requisite LoginModules are  configured for an application, then at least one Sufficient or Optional  LoginModule must succeed.  ModuleOptions is a space separated list of LoginModule-specific values  which are passed directly to the underlying LoginModules. Options are  defined by the LoginModule itself, and control the behavior within it. For  example, a LoginModule may define options to support debugging/testing  capabilities. The correct way to specify options in the Configuration is by  using the following key-value pairing: debug=true. The key and value  should be separated by an 'equals' symbol, and the value should be  surrounded by double quotes. If a String in the form, ${system.property},  occurs in the value, it will be expanded to the value of the system  property. Note that there is no limit to the number of options a  LoginModule may define.  The following represents an example Configuration entry based on the syntax  above:   Login { com.sun.security.auth.module.UnixLoginModule required; com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule optional useTicketCache=true ticketCache=${user.home}${/}tickets; };   This Configuration specifies that an application named, Login, requires  users to first authenticate to the  com.sun.security.auth.module.UnixLoginModule, which is required to succeed.  Even if the UnixLoginModule authentication fails, the  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule still gets invoked. This helps  hide the source of failure. Since the Krb5LoginModule is Optional, the  overall authentication succeeds only if the UnixLoginModule (Required)  succeeds.  Also note that the LoginModule-specific options, useTicketCache=true and  ticketCache=${user.home}${/}tickets, are passed to the Krb5LoginModule.  These options instruct the Krb5LoginModule to use the ticket cache at the  specified location. The system properties, user.home and /  (file.separator), are expanded to their respective values.  There is only one Configuration object installed in the runtime at any  given time. A Configuration object can be installed by calling the  setConfiguration method. The installed Configuration object can be obtained  by calling the getConfiguration method.  If no Configuration object has been installed in the runtime, a call to  getConfiguration installs an instance of the default Configuration  implementation (a default subclass implementation of this abstract class).  The default Configuration implementation can be changed by setting the  value of the login.configuration.provider security property (in the Java  security properties file) to the fully qualified name of the desired  Configuration subclass implementation. The Java security properties file is  located in the file named <JAVA_HOME>/lib/security/java.security.  <JAVA_HOME> refers to the value of the java.home system property, and  specifies the directory where the JRE is installed.  Application code can directly subclass Configuration to provide a custom  implementation.

1721,32478,444629,448373,8,public final class URI   ,"Represents a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) reference.  Aside from some minor deviations noted below, an instance of this class  represents a URI reference as defined by RFC 2396: Uniform Resource  Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax, amended by RFC 2732: Format for Literal  IPv6 Addresses in URLs. The Literal IPv6 address format also supports  scope_ids. The syntax and usage of scope_ids is described here. This class  provides constructors for creating URI instances from their components or  by parsing their string forms, methods for accessing the various components  of an instance, and methods for normalizing, resolving, and relativizing  URI instances. Instances of this class are immutable.   URI syntax and components  At the highest level a URI reference (hereinafter simply URI) in string  form has the syntax      [scheme:]scheme-specific-part[\#fragment]  where square brackets [...] delineate optional components and the  characters : and \# stand for themselves.  An absolute URI specifies a scheme; a URI that is not absolute is said to  be relative. URIs are also classified according to whether they are opaque  or hierarchical.  An opaque URI is an absolute URI whose scheme-specific part does not begin  with a slash character ('/'). Opaque URIs are not subject to further  parsing. Some examples of opaque URIs are:      mailto:java-net@java.sun.com 	     news:comp.lang.java 	     urn:isbn:096139210x  A hierarchical URI is either an absolute URI whose scheme-specific part  begins with a slash character, or a relative URI, that is, a URI that does  not specify a scheme. Some examples of hierarchical URIs are:      http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/     docs/guide/collections/designfaq.html\#28     ../../../demo/jfc/SwingSet2/src/SwingSet2.java     file:///~/calendar  A hierarchical URI is subject to further parsing according to the syntax      [scheme:][//authority][path][?query][\#fragment]  where the characters :, /, ?, and \# stand for themselves. The  scheme-specific part of a hierarchical URI consists of the characters  between the scheme and fragment components.  The authority component of a hierarchical URI is, if specified, either  server-based or registry-based. A server-based authority parses according  to the familiar syntax      [user-info@]host[:port]  where the characters @ and : stand for themselves. Nearly all URI schemes  currently in use are server-based. An authority component that does not  parse in this way is considered to be registry-based.  The path component of a hierarchical URI is itself said to be absolute if  it begins with a slash character ('/'); otherwise it is relative. The path  of a hierarchical URI that is either absolute or specifies an authority is  always absolute.  All told, then, a URI instance has the following nine components:      Component 	Type     scheme 	String     scheme-specific-part     	String     authority 	String     user-info 	String     host 	String     port 	int     path 	String     query 	String     fragment 	String  In a given instance any particular component is either undefined or  defined with a distinct value. Undefined string components are represented  by null, while undefined integer components are represented by -1. A string  component may be defined to have the empty string as its value; this is not  equivalent to that component being undefined.  Whether a particular component is or is not defined in an instance depends  upon the type of the URI being represented. An absolute URI has a scheme  component. An opaque URI has a scheme, a scheme-specific part, and possibly  a fragment, but has no other components. A hierarchical URI always has a  path (though it may be empty) and a scheme-specific-part (which at least  contains the path), and may have any of the other components. If the  authority component is present and is server-based then the host component  will be defined and the user-information and port components may be  defined.   Operations on URI instances  The key operations supported by this class are those of normalization,  resolution, and relativization.  Normalization is the process of removing unnecessary . and .. segments  from the path component of a hierarchical URI. Each . segment is simply  removed. A .. segment is removed only if it is preceded by a non-..  segment. Normalization has no effect upon opaque URIs.  Resolution is the process of resolving one URI against another, base URI.  The resulting URI is constructed from components of both URIs in the manner  specified by RFC 2396, taking components from the base URI for those not  specified in the original. For hierarchical URIs, the path of the original  is resolved against the path of the base and then normalized. The result,  for example, of resolving      docs/guide/collections/designfaq.html\#28          (1)  against the base URI http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/ is the result URI      http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/collections/designfaq.html\#28  Resolving the relative URI      ../../../demo/jfc/SwingSet2/src/SwingSet2.java    (2)  against this result yields, in turn,      http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/demo/jfc/SwingSet2/src/SwingSet2.java  Resolution of both absolute and relative URIs, and of both absolute and  relative paths in the case of hierarchical URIs, is supported. Resolving  the URI file:///~calendar against any other URI simply yields the original  URI, since it is absolute. Resolving the relative URI (2) above against the  relative base URI (1) yields the normalized, but still relative, URI      demo/jfc/SwingSet2/src/SwingSet2.java  Relativization, finally, is the inverse of resolution: For any two  normalized URIs u and v,      u.relativize(u.resolve(v)).equals(v)  and     u.resolve(u.relativize(v)).equals(v)  .  This operation is often useful when constructing a document containing URIs  that must be made relative to the base URI of the document wherever  possible. For example, relativizing the URI      http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/index.html  against the base URI      http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3  yields the relative URI docs/guide/index.html.   Character categories  RFC 2396 specifies precisely which characters are permitted in the various  components of a URI reference. The following categories, most of which are  taken from that specification, are used below to describe these  constraints:      alpha 	The US-ASCII alphabetic characters, 'A' through 'Z' and 'a'     through 'z'     digit 	The US-ASCII decimal digit characters, '0' through '9'     alphanum 	All alpha and digit characters     unreserved     	All alphanum characters together with those in the     string _-!.~'()*     punct 	The characters in the string ,;:$&+=     reserved 	All punct characters together with those in the string      ?/[]@     escaped 	Escaped octets, that is, triplets consisting of the percent     character ('%') followed by two hexadecimal digits ('0'-'9', 'A'-'F',     and 'a'-'f')     other 	The Unicode characters that are not in the US-ASCII character     set, are not control characters (according to the      Character.isISOControl method), and are not space characters (according     to the Character.isSpaceChar method)  (Deviation from RFC 2396, which     is limited to US-ASCII)  The set of all legal URI characters consists of the unreserved, reserved,  escaped, and other characters.   Escaped octets, quotation, encoding, and decoding  RFC 2396 allows escaped octets to appear in the user-info, path, query, and  fragment components. Escaping serves two purposes in URIs:     * To encode non-US-ASCII characters when a URI is required to conform       strictly to RFC 2396 by not containing any other characters.      * To quote characters that are otherwise illegal in a component. The       user-info, path, query, and fragment components differ slightly in       terms of which characters are considered legal and illegal.  These purposes are served in this class by three related operations:     * A character is encoded by replacing it with the sequence of escaped       octets that represent that character in the UTF-8 character set. The       Euro currency symbol (' u20AC'), for example, is encoded as        %E2%82%AC. (Deviation from RFC 2396, which does not specify any       particular character set.)      * An illegal character is quoted simply by encoding it. The space       character, for example, is quoted by replacing it with %20. UTF-8       contains US-ASCII, hence for US-ASCII characters this transformation       has exactly the effect required by RFC 2396.      * A sequence of escaped octets is decoded by replacing it with the       sequence of characters that it represents in the UTF-8 character set.       UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence decoding has the effect of de-quoting       any quoted US-ASCII characters as well as that of decoding any       encoded non-US-ASCII characters. If a decoding error occurs when       decoding the escaped octets then the erroneous octets are replaced by        ' uFFFD', the Unicode replacement character.  These operations are exposed in the constructors and methods of this class  as follows:     * The single-argument constructor requires any illegal characters in       its argument to be quoted and preserves any escaped octets and other        characters that are present.      * The multi-argument constructors quote illegal characters as required       by the components in which they appear. The percent character ('%')       is always quoted by these constructors. Any other characters are       preserved.      * The getRawUserInfo, getRawPath, getRawQuery, getRawFragment,        getRawAuthority, and getRawSchemeSpecificPart methods return the       values of their corresponding components in raw form, without       interpreting any escaped octets. The strings returned by these       methods may contain both escaped octets and other characters, and       will not contain any illegal characters.      * The getUserInfo, getPath, getQuery, getFragment, getAuthority, and        getSchemeSpecificPart methods decode any escaped octets in their       corresponding components. The strings returned by these methods may       contain both other characters and illegal characters, and will not       contain any escaped octets.      * The toString method returns a URI string with all necessary quotation       but which may contain other characters.      * The toASCIIString method returns a fully quoted and encoded URI       string that does not contain any other characters.   Identities  For any URI u, it is always the case that      new URI(u.toString()).equals(u) .  For any URI u that does not contain redundant syntax such as two slashes  before an empty authority (as in file:///tmp/ ) or a colon following a host  name but no port (as in http://java.sun.com: ), and that does not encode  characters except those that must be quoted, the following identities also  hold:      new URI(u.getScheme(),             u.getSchemeSpecificPart(),             u.getFragment())     .equals(u)  in all cases,      new URI(u.getScheme(),             u.getUserInfo(), u.getAuthority(),             u.getPath(), u.getQuery(),             u.getFragment())     .equals(u)  if u is hierarchical, and      new URI(u.getScheme(),             u.getUserInfo(), u.getHost(), u.getPort(),             u.getPath(), u.getQuery(),             u.getFragment())     .equals(u)  if u is hierarchical and has either no authority or a server-based  authority.   URIs, URLs, and URNs  A URI is a uniform resource identifier while a URL is a uniform resource  locator. Hence every URL is a URI, abstractly speaking, but not every URI  is a URL. This is because there is another subcategory of URIs, uniform  resource names (URNs), which name resources but do not specify how to  locate them. The mailto, news, and isbn URIs shown above are examples of  URNs.  The conceptual distinction between URIs and URLs is reflected in the  differences between this class and the URL class.  An instance of this class represents a URI reference in the syntactic sense  defined by RFC 2396. A URI may be either absolute or relative. A URI string  is parsed according to the generic syntax without regard to the scheme, if  any, that it specifies. No lookup of the host, if any, is performed, and no  scheme-dependent stream handler is constructed. Equality, hashing, and  comparison are defined strictly in terms of the character content of the  instance. In other words, a URI instance is little more than a structured  string that supports the syntactic, scheme-independent operations of  comparison, normalization, resolution, and relativization.  An instance of the URL class, by contrast, represents the syntactic  components of a URL together with some of the information required to  access the resource that it describes. A URL must be absolute, that is, it  must always specify a scheme. A URL string is parsed according to its  scheme. A stream handler is always established for a URL, and in fact it is  impossible to create a URL instance for a scheme for which no handler is  available. Equality and hashing depend upon both the scheme and the  Internet address of the host, if any; comparison is not defined. In other  words, a URL is a structured string that supports the syntactic operation  of resolution as well as the network I/O operations of looking up the host  and opening a connection to the specified resource.

Remarks: The StaticSiteMapProvider and XmlSiteMapProvider classes represent the default implementations of the abstract SiteMapProvider class. The XmlSiteMapProvider uses an XML file named Web.sitemap to store site map data. For more information on about the Web.sitemap file, see ASP.NET Site Maps. The SiteMapProvider class supports the concept of a site map provider hierarchy, by declaring the RootProvider and ParentProvider properties. A SiteMapProvider can be a child or parent of an provider. This enables scenarios where different content areas of a site are owned or implemented by different development groups that maintain their own site maps and site map providers. All SiteMapProvider objects are configured in the Web.config files. Any site map providers that are declared in these configuration files are loaded at run time and are used to load and process site navigation data. The SiteMap object, which keeps track of all the providers that are available to it through its Providers property collection, provides programmatic access to the navigation data that is managed by the providers. The following code example demonstrates the format that is used to declare a site map provider in a Web.config file.  The site navigation data that is loaded by these providers is used by  components of the site map infrastructure, such as the SiteMapPath and TreeView controls, to display site map information for users. If you implement your own site map provider, you can place the source file in the App_Code directory of your ASP.NET application, and then the assembly will be compiled automatically. You can also place your own site map provider in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC), and provide a fully-qualified reference to it in the Web.config file. For more information on compiler services, see Working with Assemblies and the Global Assembly Cache. Notes to Inheritors When you inherit from the SiteMapProvider class, you must override the following members: GetRootNodeCore, FindSiteMapNode, GetChildNodes, and GetParentNode.

This example includes only a sample SiteMapProvider and a sample text file that works with it. To run the example you also need an entry in the Web.config file and an .aspx page. You can find these in the documentation for the SiteMapDataSource.SiteMapProvider property. The example uses a comma-delimited file that follows an expected structure to load sitemap information. The first line of the file represents the root node of the sitemap, and subsequent lines are subnodes. Each subnode identifies its parent node by URL. An example of a file that meets these criteria is shown below.  The SimpleTextSiteMapProvider provides example implementations of all the SiteMapProvider properties and methods.

When the component's size,  location, or visibility changes, the relevant method in the listener object  is invoked, and the ComponentEvent is passed to it.  Component events are provided for notification purposes ONLY; The AWT will  automatically handle component moves and resizes internally so that GUI  layout works properly regardless of whether a program registers a  ComponentListener or not.

Summary: When implemented in a derived class, saves the workflow instance state to a data store. Remarks: You must call one of the overloaded Save methods to serialize rootActivity into a Stream. You can then choose to additionally process the Stream before writing it to your data store. However, when the workflow runtime engine calls LoadWorkflowInstanceState, you must restore an identical copy of the root activity. If you cannot save the workflow instance state to your data store, you should throw a PersistenceException with an appropriate error message. The workflow runtime engine provides locking semantics to restrict access to a workflow instance state that is saved in the data store. This can be accessed by the persistence services running in multiple hosts and pointing to the same data store. The locking semantics are designed to prevent persistence services that run in two different workflow runtimes from loading the same workflow instance into memory at the same time. Depending on the type of environment your persistence service is designed to support, you can choose whether to support this functionality. If you choose to support the runtime locking semantics, then, if a persistence service tries to save a workflow instance state that has been previously locked by another persistence service, you should throw a WorkflowOwnershipException. If unlock is true, you should unlock access to the workflow instance state after you save it. LoadWorkflowInstanceState takes the Guid of the workflow instance as a parameter. Therefore, you should save this Guid. You can also use this Guid to associate the workflow instance with the saved states of its completed scopes. You must do this because you must be able to mark these completed scopes as unneeded when the workflow instance completes. The workflow runtime engine calls SaveWorkflowInstanceState a final time when the workflow instance is completed or terminated. Therefore, if GetWorkflowStatus is equal to Completed or Terminated, you can safely delete the workflow instance and all its associated completed scopes from your data store. Alternatively, you can subscribe to the WorkflowCompleted or WorkflowTerminated events to determine when it is safe to delete records associated with the workflow instance. Whether you actually delete the records from your data store depends on your implementation. If you implement a persistence service that uses a durable store, then, to maintain consistency with the internal state of the workflow runtime engine, you should participate in workflow transaction batching to defer the actual write to your durable store until a workflow commit point. To participate in batching, add a work item that represents the pending changes to your durable store to the WorkBatch property, and implement the IPendingWork interface in your persistence service. Example: The following example demonstrates an implementation of the SaveWorkflowInstanceState method. This example is from the Custom Persistence Service sample, from the FilePersistenceService.cs file. For more information, see Custom Persistence Service Sample.",1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,7,522,mixed

1759,34700,479470,483214,8,public interface DOMConfiguration ,"The DOMConfiguration interface represents the configuration of a document  and maintains a table of recognized parameters. Using the configuration, it  is possible to change Document.normalizeDocument() behavior, such as  replacing the CDATASection nodes with Text nodes or specifying the type of  the schema that must be used when the validation of the Document is  requested. DOMConfiguration objects are also used in [DOM Level 3 Load and  Save] in the DOMParser and DOMSerializer interfaces.  The parameter names used by the DOMConfiguration object are defined  throughout the DOM Level 3 specifications. Names are case-insensitive. To  avoid possible conflicts, as a convention, names referring to parameters  defined outside the DOM specification should be made unique. Because  parameters are exposed as properties in names are recommended to follow the  section 5.16 Identifiers of [Unicode] with the addition of the character  '-' (HYPHEN-MINUS) but it is not enforced by the DOM implementation. DOM  Level 3 Core Implementations are required to recognize all parameters  defined in this specification. Some parameter values may also be required  to be supported by the implementation. Refer to the definition of the  parameter to know if a value must be supported or not.  Note: Parameters are similar to features and properties used in SAX2 [SAX ].  The following list of parameters defined in the DOM:  canonical-form     true         [optional] Canonicalize the document according to the rules         specified in [Canonical XML], such as removing the DocumentType          node (if any) from the tree, or removing superfluous namespace         declarations from each element. Note that this is limited to what         can be represented in the DOM; in particular, there is no way to         specify the order of the attributes in the DOM. In addition,         Setting this parameter to true will also set the state of the         parameters listed below. Later changes to the state of one of those         parameters will revert canonical-form back to false. Parameters         set to false: entities,  normalize-characters,         cdata-sections. Parameters set to true: namespaces,         namespace-declarations, well-formed,         element-content-whitespace. Other parameters are not changed         unless explicitly specified in the description of the parameters.     false         [required] (default)Do not canonicalize the document. cdata-sections     true         [required] (default)Keep CDATASection nodes in the document.     false         [required]Transform CDATASection nodes in the document into Text          nodes. The new Text node is then combined with any adjacent Text          node. check-character-normalization     true         [optional] Check if the characters in the document are fully         normalized, as defined in appendix B of [XML 1.1]. When a sequence         of characters is encountered that fails normalization checking, an         error with the DOMError.type equals to         check-character-normalization-failure is issued.     false         [required] (default)Do not check if characters are normalized. comments     true         [required] (default)Keep Comment nodes in the document.     false         [required]Discard Comment nodes in the document. datatype-normalization     true         [optional] Expose schema normalized values in the tree, such as          XML Schema normalized values in the case of XML Schema. Since this         parameter requires to have schema information, the validate         parameter will also be set to true. Having this parameter activated         when validate is false has no effect and no schema-normalization         will happen.          Note: Since the document contains the result of the XML 1.0         processing, this parameter does not apply to attribute value         normalization as defined in section 3.3.3 of [XML 1.0] and is only         meant for schema languages other than Document Type Definition         (DTD).      false         [required] (default) Do not perform schema normalization on the         tree. element-content-whitespace     true         [required] (default)Keep all whitespaces in the document.     false         [optional] Discard all Text nodes that contain whitespaces in         element content, as described in [element content whitespace]. The         implementation is expected to use the attribute          Text.isElementContentWhitespace to determine if a Text node should         be discarded or not. entities     true         [required] (default)Keep EntityReference nodes in the document.     false         [required] Remove all EntityReference nodes from the document,         putting the entity expansions directly in their place. Text nodes         are normalized, as defined in Node.normalize. Only unexpanded         entity references are kept in the document.      Note: This parameter does not affect Entity nodes.  error-handler     [required] Contains a DOMErrorHandler object. If an error is     encountered in the document, the implementation will call back the      DOMErrorHandler registered using this parameter. The implementation may     provide a default DOMErrorHandler object. When called,      DOMError.relatedData will contain the closest node to where the error     occurred. If the implementation is unable to determine the node where     the error occurs, DOMError.relatedData will contain the Document node.     Mutations to the document from within an error handler will result in     implementation dependent behavior. infoset     true         [required]Keep in the document the information defined in the XML         Information Set [XML Information Set] .This forces the following         parameters to false:  validate-if-schema, entities,         datatype-normalization, cdata-sections .This forces the         following parameters to true:  namespace-declarations,         well-formed, element-content-whitespace,  comments,         namespaces.Other parameters are not changed unless explicitly         specified in the description of the parameters. Note that querying         this parameter with getParameter returns true only if the         individual parameters specified above are appropriately set.     false         Setting infoset to false has no effect. namespaces     true         [required] (default) Perform the namespace processing as defined in         .     false         [optional] Do not perform the namespace processing. namespace-declarations     This parameter has no effect if the parameter namespaces is set to      false.     true         [required] (default) Include namespace declaration attributes,         specified or defaulted from the schema, in the document. See also         the sections Declaring Namespaces in [XML Namespaces] and [XML         Namespaces 1.1] .     false         [required]Discard all namespace declaration attributes. The         namespace prefixes ( Node.prefix) are retained even if this         parameter is set to false. normalize-characters     true         [optional] Fully normalized the characters in the document as         defined in appendix B of [XML 1.1].     false         [required] (default)Do not perform character normalization. schema-location     [optional] Represent a DOMString object containing a list of URIs,     separated by whitespaces (characters matching the nonterminal     production S defined in section 2.3 [XML 1.0]), that represents the     schemas against which validation should occur, i.e. the current schema.     The types of schemas referenced in this list must match the type     specified with schema-type, otherwise the behavior of an implementation     is undefined. The schemas specified using this property take precedence     to the schema information specified in the document itself. For     namespace aware schema, if a schema specified using this property and a     schema specified in the document instance (i.e. using the      schemaLocation attribute) in a schema document (i.e. using schema      import mechanisms) share the same targetNamespace, the schema specified     by the user using this property will be used. If two schemas specified     using this property share the same targetNamespace or have no     namespace, the behavior is implementation dependent. If no location has     been provided, this parameter is null.      Note: The schema-location parameter is ignored unless the     schema-type parameter value is set. It is strongly recommended that      Document.documentURI will be set so that an implementation can     successfully resolve any external entities referenced.  schema-type     [optional] Represent a DOMString object containing an absolute URI and     representing the type of the schema language used to validate a     document against. Note that no lexical checking is done on the absolute     URI.

If         validation errors are found, or no schema was found, the error         handler is notified. Schema-normalized values will not be exposed         according to the schema in used unless the parameter         datatype-normalization is true. This parameter will reevaluate:             * Attribute nodes with Attr.specified equals to false, as               specified in the description of the Attr interface;             * The value of the attribute Text.isElementContentWhitespace                for all Text nodes;             * The value of the attribute Attr.isId for all Attr nodes;             * The attributes Element.schemaTypeInfo and                Attr.schemaTypeInfo.

1770,32620,447584,451328,8,public interface ResultSet   ,"A table of data representing a database result set, which is usually  generated by executing a statement that queries the database.  A ResultSet object maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data.  Initially the cursor is positioned before the first row. The next method  moves the cursor to the next row, and because it returns false when there  are no more rows in the ResultSet object, it can be used in a while loop to  iterate through the result set.  A default ResultSet object is not updatable and has a cursor that moves  forward only. Thus, you can iterate through it only once and only from the  first row to the last row. It is possible to produce ResultSet objects that  are scrollable and/or updatable. The following code fragment, in which con  is a valid Connection object, illustrates how to make a result set that is  scrollable and insensitive to updates by others, and that is updatable. See  ResultSet fields for other options.    Statement stmt = con.createStatement( ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE); ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(SELECT a, b FROM TABLE2); // rs will be scrollable, will not show changes made by others, // and will be updatable    The ResultSet interface provides getter methods (getBoolean, getLong, and  so on) for retrieving column values from the current row. Values can be  retrieved using either the index number of the column or the name of the  column. In general, using the column index will be more efficient. Columns  are numbered from 1. For maximum portability, result set columns within  each row should be read in left-to-right order, and each column should be  read only once.  For the getter methods, a JDBC driver attempts to convert the underlying  data to the Java type specified in the getter method and returns a suitable  Java value. The JDBC specification has a table showing the allowable  mappings from SQL types to Java types that can be used by the ResultSet  getter methods.  Column names used as input to getter methods are case insensitive. When a  getter method is called with a column name and several columns have the  same name, the value of the first matching column will be returned. The  column name option is designed to be used when column names are used in the  SQL query that generated the result set. For columns that are NOT  explicitly named in the query, it is best to use column numbers. If column  names are used, the programmer should take care to guarantee that they  uniquely refer to the intended columns, which can be assured with the SQL  AS clause.  A set of updater methods were added to this interface in the JDBC 2.0 API  (JavaTM 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.2). The comments regarding  parameters to the getter methods also apply to parameters to the updater  methods.  The updater methods may be used in two ways:     1. to update a column value in the current row. In a scrollable        ResultSet object, the cursor can be moved backwards and forwards, to       an absolute position, or to a position relative to the current row.       The following code fragment updates the NAME column in the fifth row       of the ResultSet object rs and then uses the method updateRow to       update the data source table from which rs was derived.          rs.absolute(5); // moves the cursor to the fifth row of rs rs.updateString(NAME, AINSWORTH); // updates the // NAME column of row 5 to be AINSWORTH rs.updateRow(); // updates the row in the data source       2. to insert column values into the insert row. An updatable ResultSet        object has a special row associated with it that serves as a staging       area for building a row to be inserted. The following code fragment       moves the cursor to the insert row, builds a three-column row, and       inserts it into rs and into the data source table using the method        insertRow.          rs.moveToInsertRow(); // moves cursor to the insert row rs.updateString(1, AINSWORTH); // updates the // first column of the insert row to be AINSWORTH rs.updateInt(2,35); // updates the second column to be 35 rs.updateBoolean(3, true); // updates the third column to true rs.insertRow(); rs.moveToCurrentRow();    A ResultSet object is automatically closed when the Statement object that  generated it is closed, re-executed, or used to retrieve the next result  from a sequence of multiple results.  The number, types and properties of a ResultSet object's columns are  provided by the ResulSetMetaData object returned by the  ResultSet.getMetaData method.

A concrete implementation of the PKIXCertPathChecker class can be created  to extend the PKIX certification path validation algorithm. For example, an  implementation may check for and process a critical private extension of  each certificate in a certification path.  Instances of PKIXCertPathChecker are passed as parameters using the  setCertPathCheckers or addCertPathChecker methods of the PKIXParameters  and PKIXBuilderParameters class. Each of the PKIXCertPathCheckers check  methods will be called, in turn, for each certificate processed by a PKIX  CertPathValidator or CertPathBuilder implementation.  A PKIXCertPathChecker may be called multiple times on successive  certificates in a certification path. Concrete subclasses are expected to  maintain any internal state that may be necessary to check successive  certificates. The init method is used to initialize the internal state of  the checker so that the certificates of a new certification path may be  checked. A stateful implementation must override the clone method if  necessary in order to allow a PKIX CertPathBuilder to efficiently backtrack  and try other paths. In these situations, the CertPathBuilder is able to  restore prior path validation states by restoring the cloned  PKIXCertPathCheckers.  The order in which the certificates are presented to the  PKIXCertPathChecker may be either in the forward direction (from target to  most-trusted CA) or in the reverse direction (from most-trusted CA to  target). A PKIXCertPathChecker implementation must support reverse checking  (the ability to perform its checks when it is presented with certificates  in the reverse direction) and may support forward checking (the ability to  perform its checks when it is presented with certificates in the forward  direction). The isForwardCheckingSupported method indicates whether forward  checking is supported.

Remarks: A ManipulationProcessor2D object treats a collection of manipulators as a composite object. Your application is then freed from the necessity of tracking and managing individual manipulators. A manipulation processor by itself does not cause an element to move. Your application begins a manipulation as necessary, and then receives information from a manipulation processor by listening to the Started, Delta and Completed events. The values received via these events enable you to change the location, size or orientation of an element as needed. You inform a manipulation processor which types of manipulations are allowed (translate, scale, rotate) by setting the SupportedManipulations property. You can then provide non-conditional logic to the transformation of the element that is being manipulated. For instance, instead of checking if rotation is enabled before changing the orientation of an element, you can unconditionally apply the rotation factor received from the manipulation processor; if rotation is not enabled, the manipulation processor will report that no rotational change has occurred. When an element that is being manipulated is released (all manipulators are removed), you can use inertia processing to simulate friction and cause the element to gradually slow its movements before coming to a stop.

This class cannot be inherited. Remarks: This class represents the <CipherReference> element in XML encryption. It identifies a source which, when processed, yields the encrypted data. The actual encrypted data referenced by the <CipherReference> is obtained by the following process. The <CipherReference> URI property contains a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is dereferenced. If the <CipherReference> element also contains a transform chain, the data resulting from dereferencing the URI is transformed as specified to produce the encrypted data. For example, if the encrypted data is base64-encoded within an XML document, the transforms would specify an XPath expression followed by a base64 decoding so the encrypted data can be extracted. The syntax of the URI and transforms is similar to that of XML digital signatures. However, in XML digital signatures, both generation and validation processing start with the same source data and perform that transform in the same order. In XML encryption, the decrypting application has only the encrypted data and the specified transforms. The transforms are enumerated in the order necessary to obtain the encrypted data. Note   By default, you cannot dereference cipher references from documents with unknown sources, such as files from a Web site, because the DocumentEvidence property is null. For example, when you attempt to decrypt a file containing a <CipherReference> element that references a file on the Web, a SecurityException is thrown, even if the request is made by a fully trusted assembly. If you are sure the documents you are decrypting can be trusted, you can change this behavior for fully trusted applications by using the following code:  Note The HostProtectionAttribute attribute applied to this type or member has the following Resources property value: MayLeakOnAbort.

1791,32381,442844,446588,8,public final class RuntimePermission   ,"This class is for runtime permissions. A RuntimePermission contains a name  (also referred to as a target name) but no actions list; you either have  the named permission or you don't.  The target name is the name of the runtime permission (see below). The  naming convention follows the hierarchical property naming convention.  Also, an asterisk may appear at the end of the name, following a ., or by  itself, to signify a wildcard match. For example: loadLibrary.* or * is  valid, *loadLibrary or a*b is not valid.  The following table lists all the possible RuntimePermission target names,  and for each provides a description of what the permission allows and a  discussion of the risks of granting code the permission.  Permission Target Name 	What the Permission Allows 	Risks of Allowing this  Permission createClassLoader 	Creation of a class loader 	This is an extremely  dangerous permission to grant. Malicious applications that can instantiate  their own class loaders could then load their own rogue classes into the  system. These newly loaded classes could be placed into any protection  domain by the class loader, thereby automatically granting the classes the  permissions for that domain. getClassLoader 	Retrieval of a class loader (e.g., the class loader for the  calling class) 	This would grant an attacker permission to get the class  loader for a particular class. This is dangerous because having access to a  class's class loader allows the attacker to load other classes available to  that class loader. The attacker would typically otherwise not have access  to those classes. setContextClassLoader 	Setting of the context class loader used by a thread 	 The context class loader is used by system code and extensions when they  need to lookup resources that might not exist in the system class loader.  Granting setContextClassLoader permission would allow code to change which  context class loader is used for a particular thread, including system  threads. enableContextClassLoaderOverride 	Subclass implementation of the thread  context class loader methods 	The context class loader is used by system  code and extensions when they need to lookup resources that might not exist  in the system class loader. Granting enableContextClassLoaderOverride  permission would allow a subclass of Thread to override the methods that  are used to get or set the context class loader for a particular thread. setSecurityManager 	Setting of the security manager (possibly replacing an  existing one) 	The security manager is a class that allows applications to  implement a security policy. Granting the setSecurityManager permission  would allow code to change which security manager is used by installing a  different, possibly less restrictive security manager, thereby bypassing  checks that would have been enforced by the original security manager. createSecurityManager 	Creation of a new security manager 	This gives code  access to protected, sensitive methods that may disclose information about  other classes or the execution stack. getenv.{variable name} 	Reading of the value of the specified environment  variable 	This would allow code to read the value, or determine the  existence, of a particular environment variable. This is dangerous if the  variable contains confidential data. exitVM.{exit status} 	Halting of the Java Virtual Machine with the  specified exit status 	This allows an attacker to mount a denial-of-service  attack by automatically forcing the virtual machine to halt. Note: The  exitVM.* permission is automatically granted to all code loaded from the  application class path, thus enabling applications to terminate themselves.  Also, the exitVM permission is equivalent to exitVM.*. shutdownHooks 	Registration and cancellation of virtual-machine shutdown  hooks 	This allows an attacker to register a malicious shutdown hook that  interferes with the clean shutdown of the virtual machine. setFactory 	Setting of the socket factory used by ServerSocket or Socket,  or of the stream handler factory used by URL 	This allows code to set the  actual implementation for the socket, server socket, stream handler, or RMI  socket factory. An attacker may set a faulty implementation which mangles  the data stream. setIO 	Setting of System.out, System.in, and System.err 	This allows  changing the value of the standard system streams. An attacker may change  System.in to monitor and steal user input, or may set System.err to a  null OutputStream, which would hide any error messages sent to  System.err. modifyThread 	Modification of threads, e.g., via calls to Thread interrupt , stop, suspend, resume, setDaemon, setPriority, setName and  setUncaughtExceptionHandler methods 	This allows an attacker to modify the  behaviour of any thread in the system. stopThread 	Stopping of threads via calls to the Thread stop method 	This  allows code to stop any thread in the system provided that it is already  granted permission to access that thread. This poses as a threat, because  that code may corrupt the system by killing existing threads. modifyThreadGroup 	modification of thread groups, e.g., via calls to  ThreadGroup destroy, getParent, resume, setDaemon, setMaxPriority, stop,  and suspend methods 	This allows an attacker to create thread groups and  set their run priority. getProtectionDomain 	Retrieval of the ProtectionDomain for a class 	This  allows code to obtain policy information for a particular code source.  While obtaining policy information does not compromise the security of the  system, it does give attackers additional information, such as local file  names for example, to better aim an attack. getFileSystemAttributes 	Retrieval of file system attributes 	This allows  code to obtain file system information such as disk usage or disk space  available to the caller. This is potentially dangerous because it discloses  information about the system hardware configuration and some information  about the caller's privilege to write files. readFileDescriptor 	Reading of file descriptors 	This would allow code to  read the particular file associated with the file descriptor read. This is  dangerous if the file contains confidential data. writeFileDescriptor 	Writing to file descriptors 	This allows code to write  to a particular file associated with the descriptor. This is dangerous  because it may allow malicious code to plant viruses or at the very least,  fill up your entire disk. loadLibrary.{library name} 	Dynamic linking of the specified library 	It is  dangerous to allow an applet permission to load native code libraries,  because the Java security architecture is not designed to and does not  prevent malicious behavior at the level of native code. accessClassInPackage.{package name} 	Access to the specified package via a  class loader's loadClass method when that class loader calls the  SecurityManager checkPackageAccess method 	This gives code access to  classes in packages to which it normally does not have access. Malicious  code may use these classes to help in its attempt to compromise security in  the system. defineClassInPackage.{package name} 	Definition of classes in the specified  package, via a class loader's defineClass method when that class loader  calls the SecurityManager checkPackageDefinition method. 	This grants code  permission to define a class in a particular package. This is dangerous  because malicious code with this permission may define rogue classes in  trusted packages like java.security or java.lang, for example. accessDeclaredMembers 	Access to the declared members of a class 	This  grants code permission to query a class for its public, protected, default  (package) access, and private fields and/or methods. Although the code  would have access to the private and protected field and method names, it  would not have access to the private/protected field data and would not be  able to invoke any private methods. Nevertheless, malicious code may use  this information to better aim an attack. Additionally, it may invoke any  public methods and/or access public fields in the class. This could be  dangerous if the code would normally not be able to invoke those methods  and/or access the fields because it can't cast the object to the  class/interface with those methods and fields. queuePrintJob 	Initiation of a print job request 	This could print  sensitive information to a printer, or simply waste paper. getStackTrace 	Retrieval of the stack trace information of another thread. 	 This allows retrieval of the stack trace information of another thread.  This might allow malicious code to monitor the execution of threads and  discover vulnerabilities in applications. setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler 	Setting the default handler to be used  when a thread terminates abruptly due to an uncaught exception 	This allows  an attacker to register a malicious uncaught exception handler that could  interfere with termination of a thread preferences 	Represents the permission required to get access to the  java.util.prefs.Preferences implementations user or system root which in  turn allows retrieval or update operations within the Preferences  persistent backing store.) 	This permission allows the user to read from or  write to the preferences backing store if the user running the code has  sufficient OS privileges to read/write to that backing store. The actual  backing store may reside within a traditional filesystem directory or  within a registry depending on the platform OS  See Also:     BasicPermission, Permission, Permissions, PermissionCollection,      SecurityManager, Serialized Form",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,7,1457,mixed

This class cannot be inherited. Remarks: This attribute is used to specify information for methods that can be called from client script. The attribute lets you specify which HTTP verb (GET or POST) can be used to invoke a method. It also lets you specify whether the response is formatted by using either JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or XML. The ScriptMethodAttribute attribute is optional. (However, methods that can be called from client script must have the System.Web.Services.WebMethodAttribute attribute applied.). If a method is not marked with ScriptMethodAttribute, the method will be called by using the HTTP POST command and the response will be serialized as JSON. You cannot override this setting from script. ScriptMethodAttribute takes only named parameters. The following are the properties of the ScriptMethodAttribute class that can be used as named parameters: UseHttpGet Specifies whether the method will be invoked by using the HTTP GET command. The default is false. Security Note Setting the UseHttpGet property to true might pose a security risk for your application if you are working with sensitive data or transactions. In GET requests, the message is encoded by the browser into the URL and is therefore an easier target for tampering. For both GET and POST requests, you should follow security guidelines to protect sensitive data. ResponseFormat Specifies whether the response will be serialized as JSON or as XML. The default is Json. The ResponseFormat property is useful to specify XML as the return type when the method returns an XmlDocument or an XmlElement object. XmlSerializeString Specifies whether all return types, including string types, are serialized as XML. The value of the XmlSerializeString property is ignored when the response is serialized as JSON. For more information about how to use attributes, see Extending Metadata Using Attributes.

1799,33931,467702,471446,8,public abstract class BasicTextUI   ,"Basis of a text components look-and-feel. This provides the basic editor  view and controller services that may be useful when creating a  look-and-feel for an extension of JTextComponent.  Most state is held in the associated JTextComponent as bound properties,  and the UI installs default values for the various properties. This default  will install something for all of the properties. Typically, a LAF  implementation will do more however. At a minimum, a LAF would generally  install key bindings.  This class also provides some concurrency support if the Document  associated with the JTextComponent is a subclass of AbstractDocument.  Access to the View (or View hierarchy) is serialized between any thread  mutating the model and the Swing event thread (which is expected to render,  do model/view coordinate translation, etc). Any access to the root view  should first acquire a read-lock on the AbstractDocument and release that  lock in a finally block.  An important method to define is the getPropertyPrefix() method which is  used as the basis of the keys used to fetch defaults from the UIManager.  The string should reflect the type of TextUI (eg. TextField, TextArea, etc)  without the particular LAF part of the name (eg Metal, Motif, etc).  To build a view of the model, one of the following strategies can be  employed.     1. One strategy is to simply redefine the ViewFactory interface in the       UI. By default, this UI itself acts as the factory for View       implementations. This is useful for simple factories. To do this       reimplement the create(javax.swing.text.Element) method.    2. A common strategy for creating more complex types of documents is to       have the EditorKit implementation return a factory. Since the       EditorKit ties all of the pieces necessary to maintain a type of       document, the factory is typically an important part of that and       should be produced by the EditorKit implementation.

If a security manager exists, its checkPermission method is called with a RuntimePermission(getenv.+name) permission. This may result in a SecurityException being thrown. If no exception is thrown the value of the variable name is returned.  System properties and environment variables are both conceptually mappings between names and values. Both mechanisms can be used to pass user-defined information to a Java process. Environment variables have a more global effect, because they are visible to all descendants of the process which defines them, not just the immediate Java subprocess. They can have subtly different semantics, such as case insensitivity, on different operating systems. For these reasons, environment variables are more likely to have unintended side effects. It is best to use system properties where possible. Environment variables should be used when a global effect is desired, or when an external system interface requires an environment variable (such as PATH).  On UNIX systems the alphabetic case of name is typically significant, while on Microsoft Windows systems it is typically not. For example, the expression System.getenv(FOO).equals(System.getenv(foo)) is likely to be true on Microsoft Windows.

Remarks: In a visual designer, when you switch from Source to Design view, the markup source code that describes a control that is derived from the BaseValidator abstract class is parsed and a design-time version of the control is created on the design surface. When you switch back to Source view, the design-time control is persisted to markup source code and edited into the markup for the Web page. The BaseValidatorDesigner objects provide design-time support for controls that are derived from the BaseValidator class in a visual designer. The GetDesignTimeHtml method gets the markup that is used to render the associated control at design time. Example: The following example derives the SimpleCompareValidator control from the CompareValidator class. SimpleCompareValidator is a copy of the CompareValidator. The example also derives the designer SimpleCompareValidatorDesigner from the BaseValidatorDesigner class and uses the DesignerAttribute attribute to associate the SimpleCompareValidatorDesigner class with the SimpleCompareValidator control. SimpleCompareValidatorDesigner overrides the GetDesignTimeHtml method to draw a solid border around the SimpleCompareValidator control at design time if the value of the BorderStyle property of the control is the NotSet or None field.

Remarks: The Route class enables you to specify how routing is processed in an ASP.NET application. You create a Route object for each URL pattern that you want to map to a class that can handle requests that correspond to that pattern. You then add the route to the Routes collection. When the application receives a request, ASP.NET routing iterates through the routes in the Routes collection to find the first route that matches the pattern of the URL. Set the Url property to a URL pattern. The URL pattern consists of segments that come after the application name in an HTTP request. For example, in the URL http://www.contoso.com/products/show/beverages, the pattern applies to products/show/beverages. A pattern with three segments, such as {controller}/{action}/{id}, matches the URL http://www.contoso.com/products/show/beverages. Each segment is delimited by the / character. When a segment is enclosed in braces ( { and } ), the segment is referred to a URL parameter. ASP.NET routing retrieves the value from the request and assigns it to the URL parameter. In the previous example, the URL parameter action is assigned the value show. If the segment is not enclosed in braces, the value is treated as a literal value. Set the Defaults property to a RouteValueDictionary object that includes values that are used if a parameter is missing from the URL or to set additional values that are not parameterized in the URL. Set the Constraints property to a RouteValueDictionary object that contains values that are either regular expressions or IRouteConstraint objects. These values are used to determine whether a parameter value is valid. Example: The following example shows how to create a Route object and add it to the Routes property.

1863,32236,438526,442270,8,public class AffineTransform   ,"The AffineTransform class represents a 2D affine transform that performs a  linear mapping from 2D coordinates to other 2D coordinates that preserves  the straightness and parallelness of lines. Affine transformations can  be constructed using sequences of translations, scales, flips, rotations,  and shears.  Such a coordinate transformation can be represented by a 3 row by 3 column  matrix with an implied last row of [ 0 0 1 ]. This matrix transforms source  coordinates (x,y) into destination coordinates (x',y') by considering them  to be a column vector and multiplying the coordinate vector by the matrix  according to the following process:   [ x']   [  m00  m01  m02  ] [ x ]   [ m00x + m01y + m02 ] [ y'] = [  m10  m11  m12  ] [ y ] = [ m10x + m11y + m12 ] [ 1 ]   [   0    0    1   ] [ 1 ]   [         1         ]    Handling 90-Degree Rotations  In some variations of the rotate methods in the AffineTransform class, a  double-precision argument specifies the angle of rotation in radians. These  methods have special handling for rotations of approximately 90 degrees  (including multiples such as 180, 270, and 360 degrees), so that the common  case of quadrant rotation is handled more efficiently. This special  handling can cause angles very close to multiples of 90 degrees to be  treated as if they were exact multiples of 90 degrees. For small multiples  of 90 degrees the range of angles treated as a quadrant rotation is  approximately 0.00000121 degrees wide. This section explains why such  special care is needed and how it is implemented.  Since 90 degrees is represented as PI/2 in radians, and since PI is a  transcendental (and therefore irrational) number, it is not possible to  exactly represent a multiple of 90 degrees as an exact double precision  value measured in radians. As a result it is theoretically impossible to  describe quadrant rotations (90, 180, 270 or 360 degrees) using these  values. Double precision floating point values can get very close to  non-zero multiples of PI/2 but never close enough for the sine or cosine to  be exactly 0.0, 1.0 or -1.0. The implementations of Math.sin() and  Math.cos() correspondingly never return 0.0 for any case other than  Math.sin(0.0). These same implementations do, however, return exactly 1.0  and -1.0 for some range of numbers around each multiple of 90 degrees since  the correct answer is so close to 1.0 or -1.0 that the double precision  significand cannot represent the difference as accurately as it can for  numbers that are near 0.0.  The net result of these issues is that if the Math.sin() and Math.cos()  methods are used to directly generate the values for the matrix  modifications during these radian-based rotation operations then the  resulting transform is never strictly classifiable as a quadrant rotation  even for a simple case like rotate(Math.PI/2.0), due to minor variations in  the matrix caused by the non-0.0 values obtained for the sine and cosine.  If these transforms are not classified as quadrant rotations then  subsequent code which attempts to optimize further operations based upon  the type of the transform will be relegated to its most general  implementation.  Because quadrant rotations are fairly common, this class should handle  these cases reasonably quickly, both in applying the rotations to the  transform and in applying the resulting transform to the coordinates. To  facilitate this optimal handling, the methods which take an angle of  rotation measured in radians attempt to detect angles that are intended to  be quadrant rotations and treat them as such. These methods therefore treat  an angle theta as a quadrant rotation if either Math.sin(theta) or  Math.cos(theta) returns exactly 1.0 or -1.0. As a rule of thumb, this  property holds true for a range of approximately 0.0000000211 radians (or  0.00000121 degrees) around small multiples of Math.PI/2.0.

The default is UTF-8. Summary: Gets or sets a value specifying the content encoding of HTTP requests. Remarks: The RequestEncoding property specifies the assumed encoding of each incoming HTTP request, including posted data and query-string data. If the request comes with a request header containing a ContentType field, the AcceptCharset field of the request header overrides the RequestEncoding of the configuration. The default encoding is UTF-8, specified in the globalization section of the Machine.config file that was created when the .NET Framework was installed. If the RequestEncoding property is not specified in the Machine.config or Web.config file, encoding defaults to the Regional Options locale setting on the computer. For single-server applications, the RequestEncoding and ResponseEncoding properties should be the same. When using multiple server applications where the default server encodings are different, you can use local Web.config files to vary the RequestEncoding and ResponseEncoding properties. Example: The following code example demonstrates how to use the RequestEncoding property.

Remarks: The DataTable is a central object in the ADO.NET library. Other objects that use the DataTable include the DataSet and the DataView. When accessing DataTable objects, note that they are conditionally case sensitive. For example, if one DataTable is named #mydatatable# and another is named #Mydatatable#, a string used to search for one of the tables is regarded as case sensitive. However, if #mydatatable# exists and #Mydatatable# does not, the search string is regarded as case insensitive. A DataSet can contain two DataTable objects that have the same TableName property value but different Namespace property values. For more information about working with DataTable objects, see Creating a DataTable (ADO.NET). If you are creating a DataTable programmatically, you must first define its schema by adding DataColumn objects to the DataColumnCollection (accessed through the Columns property). For more information about adding DataColumn objects, see Adding Columns to a DataTable (ADO.NET). To add rows to a DataTable, you must first use the NewRow method to return a new DataRow object. The NewRow method returns a row with the schema of the DataTable, as it is defined by the table's DataColumnCollection. The maximum number of rows that a DataTable can store is 16,777,216. For more information, see Adding Data to a DataTable. The DataTable also contains a collection of Constraint objects that can be used to ensure the integrity of the data. For more information, see DataTable Constraints (ADO.NET). There are many DataTable events that can be used to determine when changes are made to a table. These include RowChanged, RowChanging, RowDeleting, and RowDeleted. For more information about the events that can be used with a DataTable, see Handling DataTable Events (ADO.NET). When an instance of DataTable is created, some of the read/write properties are set to initial values. For a list of these values, see the DataTable.DataTable constructor topic.

For a rotating set of files, as each file reaches a given size limit, it is  closed, rotated out, and a new file opened. Successively older files are  named by adding 0, 1, 2, etc into the base filename.  By default buffering is enabled in the IO libraries but each log record is  flushed out when it is complete.  By default the XMLFormatter class is used for formatting.  Configuration: By default each FileHandler is initialized using the  following LogManager configuration properties. If properties are not  defined (or have invalid values) then the specified default values are  used.      * java.util.logging.FileHandler.level specifies the default level for       the Handler (defaults to Level.ALL).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.filter specifies the name of a Filter        class to use (defaults to no Filter).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter specifies the name of a        Formatter class to use (defaults to java.util.logging.XMLFormatter)     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.encoding the name of the character set       encoding to use (defaults to the default platform encoding).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.limit specifies an approximate maximum       amount to write (in bytes) to any one file. If this is zero, then       there is no limit. (Defaults to no limit).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.count specifies how many output files       to cycle through (defaults to 1).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern specifies a pattern for       generating the output file name. See below for details. (Defaults to       %h/java%u.log).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.append specifies whether the       FileHandler should append onto any existing files (defaults to       false).  A pattern consists of a string that includes the following special  components that will be replaced at runtime:      * / the local pathname separator     * %t the system temporary directory     * %h the value of the user.home system property     * %g the generation number to distinguish rotated logs     * %u a unique number to resolve conflicts     * %% translates to a single percent sign % If no %g field has been specified and the file count is greater than one,  then the generation number will be added to the end of the generated  filename, after a dot.  Thus for example a pattern of %t/java%g.log with a count of 2 would  typically cause log files to be written on Solaris to /var/tmp/java0.log  and /var/tmp/java1.log whereas on Windows 95 they would be typically  written to C: TEMP java0.log and C: TEMP java1.log  Generation numbers follow the sequence 0, 1, 2, etc.  Normally the %u unique field is set to 0. However, if the FileHandler  tries to open the filename and finds the file is currently in use by  another process it will increment the unique number field and try again.  This will be repeated until FileHandler finds a file name that is not  currently in use. If there is a conflict and no %u field has been  specified, it will be added at the end of the filename after a dot. (This  will be after any automatically added generation number.)  Thus if three processes were all trying to log to fred%u.%g.txt then they  might end up using fred0.0.txt, fred1.0.txt, fred2.0.txt as the first file  in their rotating sequences.  Note that the use of unique ids to avoid conflicts is only guaranteed to  work reliably when using a local disk file system.  Since:     1.4",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,5,572,clean

1938,32382,443399,447143,8,public class Throwable   ,"The Throwable class is the superclass of all errors and exceptions in the  Java language. Only objects that are instances of this class (or one of its  subclasses) are thrown by the Java Virtual Machine or can be thrown by the  Java throw statement. Similarly, only this class or one of its subclasses  can be the argument type in a catch clause.  Instances of two subclasses, Error and Exception, are conventionally used  to indicate that exceptional situations have occurred. Typically, these  instances are freshly created in the context of the exceptional situation  so as to include relevant information (such as stack trace data).  A throwable contains a snapshot of the execution stack of its thread at the  time it was created. It can also contain a message string that gives more  information about the error. Finally, it can contain a cause: another  throwable that caused this throwable to get thrown. The cause facility is  new in release 1.4. It is also known as the chained exception facility, as  the cause can, itself, have a cause, and so on, leading to a chain of  exceptions, each caused by another.  One reason that a throwable may have a cause is that the class that throws  it is built atop a lower layered abstraction, and an operation on the upper  layer fails due to a failure in the lower layer. It would be bad design to  let the throwable thrown by the lower layer propagate outward, as it is  generally unrelated to the abstraction provided by the upper layer.  Further, doing so would tie the API of the upper layer to the details of  its implementation, assuming the lower layer's exception was a checked  exception. Throwing a wrapped exception (i.e., an exception containing a  cause) allows the upper layer to communicate the details of the failure to  its caller without incurring either of these shortcomings. It preserves the  flexibility to change the implementation of the upper layer without  changing its API (in particular, the set of exceptions thrown by its  methods).  A second reason that a throwable may have a cause is that the method that  throws it must conform to a general-purpose interface that does not permit  the method to throw the cause directly. For example, suppose a persistent  collection conforms to the Collection interface, and that its persistence  is implemented atop java.io. Suppose the internals of the add method can  throw an IOException. The implementation can communicate the details of the  IOException to its caller while conforming to the Collection interface by  wrapping the IOException in an appropriate unchecked exception. (The  specification for the persistent collection should indicate that it is  capable of throwing such exceptions.)  A cause can be associated with a throwable in two ways: via a constructor  that takes the cause as an argument, or via the initCause(Throwable)  method. New throwable classes that wish to allow causes to be associated  with them should provide constructors that take a cause and delegate  (perhaps indirectly) to one of the Throwable constructors that takes a  cause. For example:   try { lowLevelOp(); } catch (LowLevelException le) { throw new HighLevelException(le);  // Chaining-aware constructor }   Because the initCause method is public, it allows a cause to be associated  with any throwable, even a legacy throwable whose implementation predates  the addition of the exception chaining mechanism to Throwable. For example:   try { lowLevelOp(); } catch (LowLevelException le) { throw (HighLevelException) new HighLevelException().initCause(le);  // Legacy constructor }   Prior to release 1.4, there were many throwables that had their own  non-standard exception chaining mechanisms ( ExceptionInInitializerError,  ClassNotFoundException, UndeclaredThrowableException,  InvocationTargetException, WriteAbortedException,  PrivilegedActionException, PrinterIOException, RemoteException and  NamingException). All of these throwables have been retrofitted to use the  standard exception chaining mechanism, while continuing to implement their  legacy chaining mechanisms for compatibility.  Further, as of release 1.4, many general purpose Throwable classes (for  example Exception, RuntimeException, Error) have been retrofitted with  constructors that take a cause. This was not strictly necessary, due to the  existence of the initCause method, but it is more convenient and expressive  to delegate to a constructor that takes a cause.  By convention, class Throwable and its subclasses have two constructors,  one that takes no arguments and one that takes a String argument that can  be used to produce a detail message. Further, those subclasses that might  likely have a cause associated with them should have two more constructors,  one that takes a Throwable (the cause), and one that takes a String (the  detail message) and a Throwable (the cause).  Also introduced in release 1.4 is the getStackTrace() method, which allows  programmatic access to the stack trace information that was previously  available only in text form, via the various forms of the  printStackTrace() method. This information has been added to the  serialized representation of this class so getStackTrace and  printStackTrace will operate properly on a throwable that was obtained by  deserialization.

This class cannot be inherited. Remarks: This type is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the .NET Framework. For more information, see Oracle and ADO.NET. An OracleConnection object represents a unique connection to an Oracle database. In the case of a client/server database system, it is equivalent to a network connection to the server. An application that creates an instance of the OracleConnection object can set declarative or imperative security demands that require all direct and indirect callers to have adequate permission to the code. OracleConnection creates security demands by using the OraclePermission object. Users can verify that their code has adequate permissions by using the OraclePermissionAttribute object. Users and administrators can also use the Code Access Security Policy Tool (Caspol.exe) to modify security policy at the machine, user, and enterprise levels. For more information, see Security in the .NET Framework. Note Unlike the Connection object in the other .NET Framework data providers (SQL Server, OLE DB, and ODBC), OracleConnection does not support a ConnectionTimeout property. Setting a connection time-out either as a property or in the connection string has no effect, and the value returned is always zero. OracleConnection also does not support a Database property or a ChangeDatabase method. If the OracleConnection object goes out of scope, it remains open. Therefore, you should always close OracleConnection objects by calling Close or Dispose, or by using the OracleConnection object within a Using statement. Otherwise, the garbage collection might not free them immediately. Such delays can cause errors if the maximum number of connections is reached while a number of connections are waiting to be deleted by the garbage collector. By contrast, closing the connections by calling Close uses native resources more efficiently, enhancing scalability and improving overall application performance. To ensure that connections are always closed, open the connection inside of a Using block. Note To deploy high-performance applications, you often need to use connection pooling. However, when you use the .NET Framework Data Provider for Oracle, you do not need to enable connection pooling because the provider manages this automatically. Example: The following example creates an OracleCommand and an OracleConnection. The OracleConnection is opened and set as the OracleCommand.Connection property. The example then calls ExecuteNonQuery, and closes the connection. To accomplish this, the ExecuteNonQuery is passed a connection string and a query string that is an SQL INSERT statement.

This class cannot be inherited. Remarks: Parameter names are not case sensitive. When querying an Oracle database using the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Oracle (MSDAORA) and the ODBC .NET Framework Data Provider, using the LIKE clause to query values in fixed-length fields might not return all expected matches. The reason is that when Oracle matches values for fixed-length fields in a LIKE clause, it matches the entire length of the string, including any padding trailing spaces. For example, if a table in an Oracle database contains a field named #Field1# that is defined as char(3), and you enter the value #a# into a row of that table, the following code will not return the row.  This is because Oracle stores the column value as #a # (padding #a#, with trailing spaces, to the fixed field length of 3), which Oracle does not treat as a match for the parameter value of #a# in the case of a LIKE comparison of fixed-length fields. To resolve this problem, append a percentage (#%#) wildcard character to the parameter value (#a%#), or use an SQL = comparison instead. Example: The following example creates multiple instances of OdbcParameter through the OdbcParameterCollection within the OdbcDataAdapter. These parameters are used to select data from the data source and place the data in the DataSet. This example assumes that a DataSet and an OdbcDataAdapter have already been created by using the appropriate schema, commands, and connection.

However, queries that are created by using the AsOrdered operator can be streamed as long as no further sorting is performed within the query itself. Use AutoBuffered for most cases; this is the default. It strikes a balance between latency and overall performance.

Remarks: You can use client application services to retrieve role information from an existing roles service by configuring your application to use the ClientRoleProvider class. After configuration, you can determine whether an authenticated user is in a particular role by calling the IsInRole method of the IPrincipal returned by the static Thread.CurrentPrincipal property. For applications configured to use client application services, this property returns a ClientRolePrincipal. Because this class implements the IPrincipal interface, you do not need to reference it explicitly. The ClientRolePrincipal.IsInRole method internally calls the ClientRoleProvider.IsUserInRole method. The ClientRoleProvider class is a read-only role membership provider that retrieves role information for authenticated users from the roles service indicated by the ServiceUri property. The value of the ServiceUri property is typically retrieved from the application configuration file along with other configuration values. For more information, see How to: Configure Client Application Services. You can retrieve the current ClientRoleProvider instance through the static Roles.Provider property. The ClientRoleProvider class supports only the GetRolesForUser and IsUserInRole methods of the RoleProvider abstract class. When you call one of these methods for a particular user, the service provider first checks the local data cache for role information. If the cache does not contain any role information or the cache has expired, the service provider retrieves the role information from the roles service and adds it to the cache. You can specify the time-out period for the roles cache when you configure client application services. To force the GetRolesForUser method to retrieve role data from the service instead of the local cache, call the ResetCache method first. You cannot use the ClientRoleProvider class to create or delete roles, or to modify the role membership of users. To create or modify role information, you must change the configuration of the role service on the server. Example: The following example code demonstrates how to use this property to programmatically set the roles service location.

Summary: Returns the collection of DesignerActionItem objects contained in the list.

DesignerActionPropertyItem A panel item associated with a property. May also display a check mark or property editor associated with the underlying property. DesignerActionMethodItem A panel item displayed as a hyperlink and associated with a method. For every DesignerActionMethodItem and DesignerActionPropertyItem, a corresponding method or property must be added to the programmer-supplied class derived from the DesignerActionList class. Each method and property item is displayed as an active entry; interacting with it through the user interface (UI) invokes the corresponding method or property, respectively. Property items have a special panel-item interface that enables display and manipulation of their corresponding property values. For more information, see the DesignerActionPropertyItem class. The order of the items in the returned array reflects the order that they will appear in the panel. The items are grouped according to the Category property, using the following rules: The category of the first item encountered signifies the start of the first group. That group continues as long as each succeeding item is of the same category. When an item of a different, new category is encountered, a new group is created and the item is placed in it. If an item has a type different than the current group, but that category has already been used, the item is placed in the matching existing category. If an item does not have a category, it is placed in a miscellaneous group at the end of the panel. This group also contains items whose AllowAssociate property is set to false. The GetSortedActionItems method is called when the panel is first created. You must call the Refresh method to update the list of items displayed in the panel.

Return Value Type: System.Object() An array of objects that contains the return value and any reference or out parameters of the derived class method. Summary: Invokes an XML Web service method synchronously using SOAP. Remarks: Typically, you do not call the Invoke method directly, unless you are building your own proxy class for an XML Web service. A proxy class generated by the Web Services Description Language tool (Wsdl.exe) for an XML Web service exposes the XML Web service methods as names off of the proxy class. The proxy class calls the Invoke method to invoke an XML Web service method call. For example, if an XML Web service exposes an XML Web service method named Add, the proxy class also contains a method named Add. Within the code for the Add method in the proxy class, a synchronous call is made to the XML Web service method through the Invoke method and then the results are placed into the expected return type for Add. The methodName parameter is used to find the custom attributes that may have been added to the method, such as SoapDocumentMethodAttribute. SoapDocumentMethodAttribute provides additional information on the derived method which is required for the SOAP protocol. Example: The following code example is a proxy class generated by Wsdl.exe for the Math XML Web service.

2019,32689,450051,453795,8,public class Timer   ,"A facility for threads to schedule tasks for future execution in a  background thread. Tasks may be scheduled for one-time execution, or for  repeated execution at regular intervals.  Corresponding to each Timer object is a single background thread that is  used to execute all of the timer's tasks, sequentially. Timer tasks should  complete quickly. If a timer task takes excessive time to complete, it  hogs the timer's task execution thread. This can, in turn, delay the  execution of subsequent tasks, which may bunch up and execute in rapid  succession when (and if) the offending task finally completes.  After the last live reference to a Timer object goes away and all  outstanding tasks have completed execution, the timer's task execution  thread terminates gracefully (and becomes subject to garbage collection).  However, this can take arbitrarily long to occur. By default, the task  execution thread does not run as a daemon thread, so it is capable of  keeping an application from terminating. If a caller wants to terminate a  timer's task execution thread rapidly, the caller should invoke the timer's  cancel method.  If the timer's task execution thread terminates unexpectedly, for example,  because its stop method is invoked, any further attempt to schedule a task  on the timer will result in an IllegalStateException, as if the timer's  cancel method had been invoked.  This class is thread-safe: multiple threads can share a single Timer  object without the need for external synchronization.  This class does not offer real-time guarantees: it schedules tasks using  the Object.wait(long) method.  Implementation note: This class scales to large numbers of concurrently  scheduled tasks (thousands should present no problem). Internally, it uses  a binary heap to represent its task queue, so the cost to schedule a task  is O(log n), where n is the number of concurrently scheduled tasks.

This is the original SAX1 interface for reporting an element's attributes.  Unlike the new Attributes interface, it does not support Namespace-related  information.  When an attribute list is supplied as part of a startElement event, the  list will return valid results only during the scope of the event; once the  event handler returns control to the parser, the attribute list is invalid.  To save a persistent copy of the attribute list, use the SAX1  AttributeListImpl helper class.  An attribute list includes only attributes that have been specified or  defaulted: \#IMPLIED attributes will not be included.  There are two ways for the SAX application to obtain information from the  AttributeList. First, it can iterate through the entire list:   public void startElement (String name, AttributeList atts) { for (int i = 0; i < atts.getLength(); i++) { String name = atts.getName(i); String type = atts.getType(i); String value = atts.getValue(i); [...] } }   (Note that the result of getLength() will be zero if there are no  attributes.)  As an alternative, the application can request the value or type of  specific attributes:   public void startElement (String name, AttributeList atts) { String identifier = atts.getValue(id); String label = atts.getValue(label); [...] }   Since:     SAX 1.0 See Also:     startElement, AttributeListImpl",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,3,233,clean

Remarks: Implement the IPolicyImportExtension interface to search WSDL information exposed by a particular endpoint for custom policy assertions about endpoint capabilities or requirements. Typically, a policy importer searches for a specific assertion and either inserts a binding element, configures a binding element, or modifies the contract to support the requirements of the assertion. Unlike its counterpart, IPolicyExportExtension, IPolicyImportExtension does not require implementation by a BindingElement object; you can load it using the client configuration section shown in the Examples section or programmatically by adding it to the System.ServiceModel.Description.WsdlImporter constructor. passes two objects to the ImportPolicy method, a MetadataImporter and a PolicyConversionContext. Typically the PolicyConversionContext object already contains the policy assertions for each binding scope. An IPolicyImportExtension implementation performs the following steps: Locates the custom policy assertion for which it is responsible by calling either the GetBindingAssertions, GetMessageBindingAssertions, or GetOperationBindingAssertions methods, depending upon the scope. Removes the policy assertion from the assertion collection. The PolicyAssertionCollection.Remove method locates, returns, and removes the assertion in one step. Modify the binding stack or the contract by either adding a required custom BindingElement to the BindingElements property or by modifying the PolicyConversionContext.Contract property. Step 2 is important. After all policy importers have been called, checks for the existence of any policy assertions that remain. If one exists, assumes that the policy import was unsuccessful and does not import the associated binding. Important A malicious metadata supplier can attempt to send malformed XML as part of metadata in an attempt to exploit a policy importer. It is strongly recommended that custom policy importers be robust to all forms of XML that can be passed to it. Custom MetadataImporter implementations must implement their own PolicyConversionContext object to extract the policy assertions attached to the custom metadata format. If you want to export and import custom WSDL elements that are not policy assertions, see System.ServiceModel.Description.IWsdlExportExtension and System.ServiceModel.Description.IWsdlImportExtension. Note You can use custom policy importers and exporters with the ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe) by using the same configuration elements in a configuration file and the /svcutilConfig:<configFile> option. Example: The following code example shows the use of the PolicyAssertionCollection.Remove method to locate, return, and remove the assertion in one step.  The following code example shows the client application configuration file to load the custom policy importer when the System.ServiceModel.Description.MetadataResolver is invoked.

Nothing is printed  for any pages identified that do not exist in the document(s). The  attribute is associated with print-stream pages, not application-numbered  pages (for example, the page numbers found in the headers and or footers  for certain word processing applications).  In most cases, the exact pages to be printed will be generated by a device  driver and this attribute would not be required. However, when printing an  archived document which has already been formatted, the end user may elect  to print just a subset of the pages contained in the document. In this  case, if a page range of n-m is specified, the first page to be printed  will be page n. All subsequent pages of the document will be printed  through and including page m.  If a PageRanges attribute is not specified for a print job, all pages of  the document will be printed. In other words, the default value for the  PageRanges attribute is always {{1, Integer.MAX_VALUE}}.  The effect of a PageRanges attribute on a multidoc print job (a job with  multiple documents) depends on whether all the docs have the same page  ranges specified or whether different docs have different page ranges  specified, and on the (perhaps defaulted) value of the  MultipleDocumentHandling attribute.      * If all the docs have the same page ranges specified, then any value       of MultipleDocumentHandling makes sense, and the printer's processing       depends on the MultipleDocumentHandling value:           o SINGLE_DOCUMENT -- All the input docs will be combined together             into one output document.

2079,34305,490977,494721,8,"@Retention(value=RUNTIME) @Target(value={FIELD,METHOD}) public @interface XmlElementRef ","Maps a JavaBean property to a XML element derived from property's type.  Usage  @XmlElementRef annotation can be used with a JavaBean property or from  within XmlElementRefs  This annotation dynamically associates an XML element name with the  JavaBean property. When a JavaBean property is annotated with XmlElement,  the XML element name is statically derived from the JavaBean property name.  However, when this annotation is used, the XML element name is derived from  the instance of the type of the JavaBean property at runtime.   XML Schema substitution group support  XML Schema allows a XML document author to use XML element names that were  not statically specified in the content model of a schema using  substitution groups. Schema derived code provides support for substitution  groups using an element property, (section 5.5.5, Element Property of  JAXB 2.0 specification). An element property method signature is of the  form:   public void setTerm(JAXBElement<? extends Operator>); public JAXBElement<? extends Operator> getTerm();   An element factory method annotated with XmlElementDecl is used to create a  JAXBElement instance, containing an XML element name. The presence of  @XmlElementRef annotation on an element property indicates that the element  name from JAXBElement instance be used instead of deriving an XML element  name from the JavaBean property name.  The usage is subject to the following constraints:      * If the collection item type (for collection property) or property       type (for single valued property) is JAXBElement, then        @XmlElementRef}.name() and @XmlElementRef.namespace() must point an       element factory method with an @XmlElementDecl annotation in a class       annotated with @XmlRegistry (usually ObjectFactory class generated by       the schema compiler) :           o @XmlElementDecl.name() must equal @XmlElementRef.name()           o @XmlElementDecl.namespace() must equal             @XmlElementRef.namespace().     * If the collection item type (for collection property) or property       type (for single valued property) is not JAXBElement, then the type       referenced by the property or field must be annotated with        XmlRootElement.     * This annotation can be used with the following annotations:        XmlElementWrapper, XmlJavaTypeAdapter.  See Package Specification in javax.xml.bind.package javadoc for  additional common information.  Example 1: Ant Task Example  The following Java class hierarchy models an Ant build script. An Ant task  corresponds to a class in the class hierarchy. The XML element name of an  Ant task is indicated by the @XmlRootElement annotation on its  corresponding class.   @XmlRootElement(name=target) class Target { // The presence of @XmlElementRef indicates that the XML // element name will be derived from the @XmlRootElement // annotation on the type (for e.g. jar for JarTask). @XmlElementRef List<Task> tasks; }  abstract class Task { }  @XmlRootElement(name=jar) class JarTask extends Task { ... }  @XmlRootElement(name=javac) class JavacTask extends Task { ... }  <!-- XML Schema fragment --> <xs:element name=target type=Target> <xs:complexType name=Target> <xs:sequence> <xs:choice maxOccurs=unbounded> <xs:element ref=jar> <xs:element ref=javac> </xs:choice> </xs:sequence> </xs:complexType>    Thus the following code fragment:   Target target = new Target(); target.tasks.add(new JarTask()); target.tasks.add(new JavacTask()); marshal(target);   will produce the following XML output:     ....   ....     It is not an error to have a class that extends Task that doesn't have  XmlRootElement. But they can't show up in an XML instance (because they  don't have XML element names).  Example 2: XML Schema Susbstitution group support  The following example shows the annotations for XML Schema substitution  groups. The annotations and the ObjectFactory are derived from the schema.   @XmlElement class Math { //  The value of type()is //  JAXBElement.class , which indicates the XML //  element name ObjectFactory - in general a class marked //  with @XmlRegistry. (See ObjectFactory below) // //  The name() is operator, a pointer to a // factory method annotated with a //  XmlElementDecl with the name operator. Since //  operator is the head of a substitution group that //  contains elements add and sub elements, operator //  element can be substituted in an instance document by //  elements add or sub. At runtime, JAXBElement //  instance contains the element name that has been //  substituted in the XML document. // @XmlElementRef(type=JAXBElement.class,name=operator) JAXBElement<? extends Operator> term; }  @XmlRegistry class ObjectFactory { @XmlElementDecl(name=operator) JAXBElement<Operator> createOperator(Operator o) {...} @XmlElementDecl(name=add,substitutionHeadName=operator) JAXBElement<Operator> createAdd(Operator o) {...} @XmlElementDecl(name=sub,substitutionHeadName=operator) JAXBElement<Operator> createSub(Operator o) {...} }  class Operator { ... }   Thus, the following code fragment   Math m = new Math(); m.term = new ObjectFactory().createAdd(new Operator()); marshal(m);   will produce the following XML output:   <math> <add>...</add> </math>   Since:     JAXB2.0 Author:         * Kohsuke Kawaguchi, Sun Microsystems,Inc.         * Sekhar Vajjhala, Sun Microsystems, Inc.

Remarks: This class is used by the Roles and RolePrincipal classes to provide role-management services for an ASP.NET application using an authorization-manager store. You can use role management to specify different levels of authorization for your application. The authorization manager can be accessed using the Microsoft Management Console. The AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider object works with both Windows authentication and forms authentication modes. You can configure the AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider object to use either a local XML file or an Active Directory or Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM) server. When using a local file, the connection string should look like the following example.  If the local file is stored in the directory tree of an ASP.NET Web application, you can use the tilde (#~#) character to indicate the root directory. For example, to indicate that the local file is stored in the Web application's data directory, you would use a connection string similar to the following example. msxml://~\\App_Data\\datafilename.xml Security Note Storing an XML data file in the Web application directory is a potential security threat. By default, IIS will serve XML data files to the Web. To improve security when using a local data file in an ASP.NET application, you should store the data file in the App_Data directory. Files stored in the App_Data directory will not be served to the Web. If you are using an Active Directory or ADAM server for the policy store, your connection string should be similar to the following example. msldap://myserver/CN=MyAzManStore,OU=MyOU,DC=MyDomain,DC=MyDC,DC=Com The exceptions listed in the documentation for AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider object methods are the exceptions that are raised by the AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider object. Since the provider relies on the underlying Authentication Manager runtime, a COMException exception may be thrown whenever the AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider object forwards a method call to the Authentication Manager runtime. Security Note The AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider object has the following requirements for running in partial-trust environments: When using a file-based policy store in an ASP.NET application, the file I/O permissions granted by the current trust level determine whether read and write actions are allowed by the provider. The ASP.NET application must have read permission on the file to read data from the policy store, and must have write permission to save new information or update existing information in the policy store. The default Medium-trust policy file gives an ASP.NET application read/write permissions in its application directory. The default Low-trust policy file only gives an ASP.NET application read permission in its application directory. In addition, the process identity under which the ASP.NET application runs must have file-system permissions to read and/or write the policy file. When using an Active Directory or ADAM server, the ASP.NET application needs unmanaged-code permission because the internal AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider object code uses COM interop. When using the AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider object outside of ASP.NET, the calling code needs unmanaged-code permission. Example: The following code example shows a Web.config file set to use the AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider for role management.

To enable the publication of metadata using a configuration file, add the <serviceMetadata> element to the <serviceBehaviors> element and associate the element with the <service> element for which you want to publish metadata. For an example, see How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using a Configuration File. The class has the following members: The HttpGetEnabled property specifies whether metadata is returned for HTTP/GET requests. The HttpGetUrl property (in conjunction with the base addresses) specifies the HTTP/GET address. The HttpsGetEnabled property specifies whether metadata is returned for an HTTPS/GET request. The HttpsGetUrl property (in conjunction with the base addresses) specifies the HTTPS/GET address. The MetadataExporter property returns the underlying exporter. Typically the ServiceMetadataBehavior is used from an application configuration file. See the Example section for a code example. Example: The following code example demonstrates the use of ServiceMetadataBehavior in a configuration file to enable metadata support for HTTP GET and WS-Transfer GET requests.

2110,34305,490977,494721,8,"@Retention(value=RUNTIME) @Target(value={FIELD,METHOD}) public @interface XmlElementRef ","Maps a JavaBean property to a XML element derived from property's type.  Usage  @XmlElementRef annotation can be used with a JavaBean property or from  within XmlElementRefs  This annotation dynamically associates an XML element name with the  JavaBean property. When a JavaBean property is annotated with XmlElement,  the XML element name is statically derived from the JavaBean property name.  However, when this annotation is used, the XML element name is derived from  the instance of the type of the JavaBean property at runtime.   XML Schema substitution group support  XML Schema allows a XML document author to use XML element names that were  not statically specified in the content model of a schema using  substitution groups. Schema derived code provides support for substitution  groups using an element property, (section 5.5.5, Element Property of  JAXB 2.0 specification). An element property method signature is of the  form:   public void setTerm(JAXBElement<? extends Operator>); public JAXBElement<? extends Operator> getTerm();   An element factory method annotated with XmlElementDecl is used to create a  JAXBElement instance, containing an XML element name. The presence of  @XmlElementRef annotation on an element property indicates that the element  name from JAXBElement instance be used instead of deriving an XML element  name from the JavaBean property name.  The usage is subject to the following constraints:      * If the collection item type (for collection property) or property       type (for single valued property) is JAXBElement, then        @XmlElementRef}.name() and @XmlElementRef.namespace() must point an       element factory method with an @XmlElementDecl annotation in a class       annotated with @XmlRegistry (usually ObjectFactory class generated by       the schema compiler) :           o @XmlElementDecl.name() must equal @XmlElementRef.name()           o @XmlElementDecl.namespace() must equal             @XmlElementRef.namespace().     * If the collection item type (for collection property) or property       type (for single valued property) is not JAXBElement, then the type       referenced by the property or field must be annotated with        XmlRootElement.     * This annotation can be used with the following annotations:        XmlElementWrapper, XmlJavaTypeAdapter.  See Package Specification in javax.xml.bind.package javadoc for  additional common information.  Example 1: Ant Task Example  The following Java class hierarchy models an Ant build script. An Ant task  corresponds to a class in the class hierarchy. The XML element name of an  Ant task is indicated by the @XmlRootElement annotation on its  corresponding class.   @XmlRootElement(name=target) class Target { // The presence of @XmlElementRef indicates that the XML // element name will be derived from the @XmlRootElement // annotation on the type (for e.g. jar for JarTask). @XmlElementRef List<Task> tasks; }  abstract class Task { }  @XmlRootElement(name=jar) class JarTask extends Task { ... }  @XmlRootElement(name=javac) class JavacTask extends Task { ... }  <!-- XML Schema fragment --> <xs:element name=target type=Target> <xs:complexType name=Target> <xs:sequence> <xs:choice maxOccurs=unbounded> <xs:element ref=jar> <xs:element ref=javac> </xs:choice> </xs:sequence> </xs:complexType>    Thus the following code fragment:   Target target = new Target(); target.tasks.add(new JarTask()); target.tasks.add(new JavacTask()); marshal(target);   will produce the following XML output:     ....   ....     It is not an error to have a class that extends Task that doesn't have  XmlRootElement. But they can't show up in an XML instance (because they  don't have XML element names).  Example 2: XML Schema Susbstitution group support  The following example shows the annotations for XML Schema substitution  groups. The annotations and the ObjectFactory are derived from the schema.   @XmlElement class Math { //  The value of type()is //  JAXBElement.class , which indicates the XML //  element name ObjectFactory - in general a class marked //  with @XmlRegistry. (See ObjectFactory below) // //  The name() is operator, a pointer to a // factory method annotated with a //  XmlElementDecl with the name operator. Since //  operator is the head of a substitution group that //  contains elements add and sub elements, operator //  element can be substituted in an instance document by //  elements add or sub. At runtime, JAXBElement //  instance contains the element name that has been //  substituted in the XML document. // @XmlElementRef(type=JAXBElement.class,name=operator) JAXBElement<? extends Operator> term; }  @XmlRegistry class ObjectFactory { @XmlElementDecl(name=operator) JAXBElement<Operator> createOperator(Operator o) {...} @XmlElementDecl(name=add,substitutionHeadName=operator) JAXBElement<Operator> createAdd(Operator o) {...} @XmlElementDecl(name=sub,substitutionHeadName=operator) JAXBElement<Operator> createSub(Operator o) {...} }  class Operator { ... }   Thus, the following code fragment   Math m = new Math(); m.term = new ObjectFactory().createAdd(new Operator()); marshal(m);   will produce the following XML output:   <math> <add>...</add> </math>   Since:     JAXB2.0 Author:         * Kohsuke Kawaguchi, Sun Microsystems,Inc.         * Sekhar Vajjhala, Sun Microsystems, Inc.

Remarks: An OdbcConnection object represents a unique connection to a data source created by using a connection string or ODBC data source name (DSN). With a client/server database system, it is equivalent to a network connection to the server. Depending on the functionality supported by the native ODBC driver, some methods or properties of an OdbcConnection object may not be available. The OdbcConnection object uses native resources such as ODBC environment and connection handles. You should always explicitly close any open OdbcConnection objects by calling Close or Dispose before the OdbcConnection object goes out of scope, or by placing the connection within a Using statement. Not doing this leaves the freeing of these native resources to garbage collection. It might not free them immediately. This, in turn, can eventually cause the underlying driver to run out of resources or reach a maximum limit. This has resulted in intermittent failures. For example, you might experience Maximum Connections -related errors while many connections are waiting to be deleted by the garbage collector. Explicitly closing the connections allows for a more efficient use of native resources, enhancing scalability and improving overall application performance. Note To deploy high-performance applications, you frequently must use connection pooling. However, when you use the .NET Framework Data Provider for ODBC, you do not have to enable connection pooling because the provider manages this automatically. If one of the Execute methods of the OdbcCommand class causes a fatal OdbcException (for example, a SQL Server severity level of 20 or greater), the OdbcConnection may close. However, the user can reopen the connection and continue. An application that creates an instance of the OdbcConnection object can require all direct and indirect callers to have sufficient permission to the code by setting declarative or imperative security demands. OdbcConnection creates security demands by using the OdbcPermission object. Users can verify that their code has sufficient permissions by using the OdbcPermissionAttribute object. Users and administrators can also use the Code Access Security Policy Tool (Caspol.exe) to modify security policy at the computer, user, and enterprise levels. For more information, see Code Access Security and ADO.NET. For more information about handling warning and informational messages from the data source, see Connection Events (ADO.NET). Example: The following example creates an OdbcCommand and an OdbcConnection. The OdbcConnection is opened and set as the Connection property. The example then calls ExecuteNonQuery, and closes the connection. To accomplish this, the ExecuteNonQuery is passed a connection string and a query string that is an SQL INSERT statement.

If you do not specify a value for the User property during the FormsAuthentication_OnAuthenticate event, the identity supplied by the forms authentication ticket in the cookie or URL is used. The FormsAuthentication_OnAuthenticate event is only raised when the authentication Mode is set to Forms and the FormsAuthenticationModule is an active HTTP module for the application.

Remarks: In this topic: Introduction Declarative Syntax Introduction The DynamicDataManager control provides the glue between the data-bound control, the data source control, and Dynamic Data in the following ways: Sets a field generator for the data-bound control to create the correct column set when AutoGenerateColumns is set to true. The data-bound control can be a GridView control, a DetailsView control, or a FormView control. Sets the context type and table name for the data source control. The data source control for LINQ-to-SQL is LinqDataSource. The data source control for the ADO Entity Framework is EntityDataSource. Sets the AutoGenerateWhereClause to true for the data source if there is no Where clause. Expands the special dynamic parameters such as DynamicControlParameter into parameters that the data source can consume. If the LINQ-to-SQL AutoLoadForeignKeys property is set to true, loads the foreign keys. The DynamicDataManager control must be included on a page in order for data controls to use Dynamic Data support. The markup for the DynamicDataManager control must precede the markup for any controls that use Dynamic Data support. Note A DynamicDataManager control cannot be put inside an UpdatePanel control.

Summary: Gets or sets the text describing an error condition associated with the cell. Remarks: Typically, the ErrorText property is used when handling the CellValidating event of the DataGridView. If the cell's value fails some validation criteria, set the ErrorText property and cancel the commit operation by setting the Cancel property of the DataGridViewCellValidatingEventArgs to true. The text you specify is then displayed by the DataGridView, and the user is prompted to fix the error in the cell's data. When the VirtualMode property of the DataGridView is true, you can provide error text for rows and cells using the RowErrorTextNeeded and CellErrorTextNeeded events. When you assign a different ErrorText string to a cell, the CellErrorTextChanged event of the DataGridView control is raised. Example: The following code example demonstrates how to use this property when handling error conditions in an unbound DataGridView.

Remarks: Use the AsyncPostBackTrigger control to enable controls to be triggers for an UpdatePanel control. Controls that are triggers for an update panel cause a refresh of the panel's content after an asynchronous postback. Defining an asynchronous trigger control is useful in the following scenarios: For controls that are outside a panel. For controls that are inside a panel when the ChildrenAsTriggers property is false. For controls that are inside nested panels, in order to cause a refresh of parent panels. The control that the AsyncPostBackTrigger control references must be in the same naming container as the update panel for which it is a trigger. Triggers that are based on controls in other naming containers are not supported. Add AsyncPostBackTrigger controls either by using the UpdatePanelTrigger Collection Editor dialog box in the designer or by creating a Triggers element declaratively in the UpdatePanel control. The ControlID property is required, but the EventName property is optional. If the EventName property is not specified, the DefaultEventAttribute attribute of the control is used to determine the default event. For example, the default event for the Button control is the Click event. The EventName property is case-insensitive. You can also reference a naming container as a trigger. In that case, all child controls in the container that cause a postback are considered triggers for the UpdatePanel control. Programmatically adding AsyncPostBackTrigger controls is not supported. To programmatically register a postback control, use the RegisterAsyncPostBackControl method of the ScriptManager control. Then call the Update method of the UpdatePanel control when the control posts back. If you define a control using both PostBackTrigger and AsyncPostBackTrigger, an exception is thrown. Example: The following example shows how to add an AsyncPostBackTrigger control declaratively. A Button control that is outside an UpdatePanel control lets users enter a search term to find in the Products table of the Northwind database. A GridView control that is inside the UpdatePanel control shows the results. The Button control is specified as an asynchronous trigger for the UpdatePanel control.

2197,32698,449993,453737,8,"public interface SortedMap<K,V>   ","A Map that further provides a total ordering on its keys. The map is  ordered according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator  typically provided at sorted map creation time. This order is reflected  when iterating over the sorted map's collection views (returned by the  entrySet, keySet and values methods). Several additional operations are  provided to take advantage of the ordering. (This interface is the map  analogue of SortedSet.)  All keys inserted into a sorted map must implement the Comparable  interface (or be accepted by the specified comparator). Furthermore, all  such keys must be mutually comparable: k1.compareTo(k2) (or  comparator.compare(k1, k2)) must not throw a ClassCastException for any  keys k1 and k2 in the sorted map. Attempts to violate this restriction will  cause the offending method or constructor invocation to throw a  ClassCastException.  Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map (whether or not an  explicit comparator is provided) must be consistent with equals if the  sorted map is to correctly implement the Map interface. (See the  Comparable interface or Comparator interface for a precise definition of  consistent with equals.) This is so because the Map interface is defined in  terms of the equals operation, but a sorted map performs all key  comparisons using its compareTo (or compare) method, so two keys that are  deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted map,  equal. The behavior of a tree map is well-defined even if its ordering is  inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general contract of the  Map interface.  All general-purpose sorted map implementation classes should provide four  standard constructors: 1) A void (no arguments) constructor, which  creates an empty sorted map sorted according to the natural ordering of its  keys. 2) A constructor with a single argument of type Comparator, which  creates an empty sorted map sorted according to the specified comparator.  3) A constructor with a single argument of type Map, which creates a new  map with the same key-value mappings as its argument, sorted according to  the keys' natural ordering. 4) A constructor with a single argument of type  SortedMap, which creates a new sorted map with the same key-value mappings  and the same ordering as the input sorted map. There is no way to enforce  this recommendation, as interfaces cannot contain constructors.  Note: several methods return submaps with restricted key ranges. Such  ranges are half-open, that is, they include their low endpoint but not  their high endpoint (where applicable). If you need a closed range (which  includes both endpoints), and the key type allows for calculation of the  successor of a given key, merely request the subrange from lowEndpoint to  successor(highEndpoint). For example, suppose that m is a map whose keys  are strings. The following idiom obtains a view containing all of the  key-value mappings in m whose keys are between low and high, inclusive:   SortedMap<String, V> sub = m.subMap(low, high+ 0);  A similar technique can be used to generate an open range (which contains  neither endpoint). The following idiom obtains a view containing all of the  key-value mappings in m whose keys are between low and high, exclusive:   SortedMap<String, V> sub = m.subMap(low+ 0, high);  This interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework.

2203,34380,491378,495122,8,public interface Association   ,"A RegistryObject instance may be associated with zero or more  RegistryObject instances. The information model defines an Association  interface, an instance of which may be used to associate any two  RegistryObject instances.   Example of an Association  One example of such an association is between two ClassificationScheme  instances, where one ClassificationScheme supersedes the other  ClassificationScheme as shown in Figure 1. This may be the case when a new  version of a ClassificationScheme is submitted. In Figure 1, we see how an  Association is defined between a new version of the NAICS  ClassificationScheme and an older version of the NAICS  ClassificationScheme.  [Example of RegistryObject Association] Figure 1. Example of RegistryObject Association   Source and Target Objects  An Association instance represents an association between a source  RegistryObject and a target RegistryObject. These are referred to as  sourceObject and targetObject for the Association instance. It is important  which object is the sourceObject and which is the targetObject as it  determines the directional semantics of an Association. In the example in  Figure 1, it is important to make the newer version of NAICS  ClassificationScheme be the sourceObject and the older version of NAICS be  the targetObject because the associationType implies that the sourceObject  supersedes the targetObject (and not the other way around).   Association Types  Each Association must have an associationType attribute that identifies the  type of that association. The associationType attribute is a reference to  an enumeration Concept as defined by the predefined associationType  ClassificationScheme in the JAXR specification. Our example uses the  pre-defined associationType Concept named Supersedes.   Intramural Associations  A common use case for the Association interface is when a User u creates  an Association a between two RegistryObjects o1 and o2 where  association a and RegistryObjects o1 and o2 are objects that were  created by the same User u. This is the simplest use case where the  association is between two objects that are owned by same User that is  defining the Association. Such associations are referred to as intramural  associations. Figure 2 extends the previous example in Figure 1 for the  intramural association case.  [Example of Intramural Association] Figure 2. Example of Intramural Association   Extramural Association  The information model also allows a more sophisticated use case where a  User u1 creates an Association a between two RegistryObjects o1 and  o2 where association a is owned by User u1, but RegistryObjects o1  and o2 are owned by User u2 and User u3 respectively. In this use  case the Association is being defined where either or both objects that are  being associated are owned by a User different from the User defining the  Association. Such associations are referred to as extramural associations.  The Association interface provides a convenience method called isExtramural  that returns true if the Association instance is an extramural Association.  Figure 3 extends the previous example in Figure 1 for the extramural  association case. Note that it is possible for an extramural association to  have two distinct Users rather than three distinct Users as shown in Figure  3. In such case, one of the two users owns two of the three objects  involved (Association, sourceObject and targetObject).  [Example of Extramural Association] Figure 3. Example of Extramural Association   Confirmation of an Association  An association may need to be confirmed by the parties whose objects are  involved in that Association. This section describes the semantics of  confirmation of an association by the parties involved.   Confirmation of Intramural Associations  Intramural associations may be viewed as declarations of truth and do not  require any explicit steps to confirm that Association as being true. In  other words, intramural associations are implicitly considered be  confirmed.   Confirmation of Extramural Associations  Extramural associations may be viewed as a unilateral assertion that may  not be viewed as truth until it has been confirmed by the other  (extramural) parties (Users u2 and u3 in example). The  confirmAssociation method on the BusinessLifeCycleManager interface may be  called by the extramural parties that own the sourceObject or targetObject.   Visibility of Unconfirmed Associations  Extramural associations require each extramural party to confirm the  assertion being made by the extramural Association before the Association  is visible to 3rd parties that are not involved in the Association. This  ensures that unconfirmed Associations are not visible to 3rd party registry  clients.   Possible Confirmation States  Assume the most general case where there are three distinct User instances  as shown in Figure 23 for an extramural Association. The extramural  Association needs to be confirmed by both the other (extramural) parties  (Users u2 and u3 in example) in order to be fully confirmed. The  methods isConfirmedBySourceOwner and isConfiremedByTargetOwner in the  Association interface provide access to confirmation state for both the  sourceObject and targetObject. A third convenience method called  isConfirmed provides a way to determine whether the Association is fully  confirmed or not. So there are the following four possibilities related to  confirmation state of an extramural Association:     * The Association is confirmed neither by the owner of the sourceObject       nor is it confirmed by owner of targetObject.     * The Association is confirmed by the owner of the sourceObject but it       is not confirmed by owner of targetObject.     * The Association is not confirmed by the owner of the sourceObject but       it is confirmed by owner of targetObject.     * The Association is confirmed by the owner of the sourceObject and it       is confirmed by owner of targetObject. This is the only state where       the Association is fully confirmed.  Author:     Farrukh S. Najmi See Also:     RegistryObject",1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,5,885,clean

This method may write an output token to the OutpuStream, which the application will need to send to the peer for processing by its acceptSecContext call. Typically, the application would ensure this by calling the flush method on an OutputStream that encapsulates the connection between the two peers. The application can determine if a token is written to the OutputStream from the return value of this method. A return value of 0 indicates that no token was written. The application can call isEstablished to determine if the context establishment phase is complete on this side of the context. A return value of false from isEstablished indicates that more tokens are expected to be supplied to initSecContext. Upon completion of the context establishment, the available context options may be queried through the get methods.  Note that it is possible that the initSecContext method return a token for the peer, and isEstablished return true also. This indicates that the token needs to be sent to the peer, but the local end of the context is now fully established.  The GSS-API authentication tokens contain a definitive start and end. This method will attempt to read one of these tokens per invocation, and may block on the stream if only part of the token is available.

2234,32692,450218,453962,8,"public class WeakHashMap<K,V>   ","A hashtable-based Map implementation with weak keys. An entry in a  WeakHashMap will automatically be removed when its key is no longer in  ordinary use. More precisely, the presence of a mapping for a given key  will not prevent the key from being discarded by the garbage collector,  that is, made finalizable, finalized, and then reclaimed. When a key has  been discarded its entry is effectively removed from the map, so this class  behaves somewhat differently from other Map implementations.  Both null values and the null key are supported. This class has performance  characteristics similar to those of the HashMap class, and has the same  efficiency parameters of initial capacity and load factor.  Like most collection classes, this class is not synchronized. A  synchronized WeakHashMap may be constructed using the  Collections.synchronizedMap method.  This class is intended primarily for use with key objects whose equals  methods test for object identity using the == operator. Once such a key is  discarded it can never be recreated, so it is impossible to do a lookup of  that key in a WeakHashMap at some later time and be surprised that its  entry has been removed. This class will work perfectly well with key  objects whose equals methods are not based upon object identity, such as  String instances. With such recreatable key objects, however, the automatic  removal of WeakHashMap entries whose keys have been discarded may prove to  be confusing.  The behavior of the WeakHashMap class depends in part upon the actions of  the garbage collector, so several familiar (though not required) Map  invariants do not hold for this class. Because the garbage collector may  discard keys at any time, a WeakHashMap may behave as though an unknown  thread is silently removing entries. In particular, even if you synchronize  on a WeakHashMap instance and invoke none of its mutator methods, it is  possible for the size method to return smaller values over time, for the  isEmpty method to return false and then true, for the containsKey method to  return true and later false for a given key, for the get method to return a  value for a given key but later return null, for the put method to return  null and the remove method to return false for a key that previously  appeared to be in the map, and for successive examinations of the key set,  the value collection, and the entry set to yield successively smaller  numbers of elements.  Each key object in a WeakHashMap is stored indirectly as the referent of a  weak reference. Therefore a key will automatically be removed only after  the weak references to it, both inside and outside of the map, have been  cleared by the garbage collector.  Implementation note: The value objects in a WeakHashMap are held by  ordinary strong references. Thus care should be taken to ensure that value  objects do not strongly refer to their own keys, either directly or  indirectly, since that will prevent the keys from being discarded. Note  that a value object may refer indirectly to its key via the WeakHashMap  itself; that is, a value object may strongly refer to some other key object  whose associated value object, in turn, strongly refers to the key of the  first value object. One way to deal with this is to wrap values themselves  within WeakReferences before inserting, as in: m.put(key, new  WeakReference(value)), and then unwrapping upon each get.  The iterators returned by the iterator method of the collections returned  by all of this class's collection view methods are fail-fast: if the map  is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any  way except through the iterator's own remove method, the iterator will  throw a ConcurrentModificationException. Thus, in the face of concurrent  modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking  arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the  future.  Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed as it  is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the  presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators  throw ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort basis. Therefore, it  would be wrong to write a program that depended on this exception for its  correctness: the fail-fast behavior of iterators should be used only to  detect bugs.

Remarks: To modify and extend the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) exported by WsdlExporter objects, implement the IWsdlExportExtension interface on an endpoint, contract, or operation behavior (an object that implements either IContractBehavior, IEndpointBehavior, or IOperationBehavior) and add the behavior to the Behaviors, Behaviors, or Behaviors property. In addition, you can also implement IWsdlExportExtension on a BindingElement. Note IWsdlExportExtension implementations are never invoked if they are implemented as an IServiceBehavior. IWsdlExportExtension does not export custom policy assertions even though exports custom binding policy assertions to the appropriate element inside WSDL. If you want to export custom policy assertions, implement the IPolicyExportExtension interface. The metadata publication process begins by calling WsdlExporter.ExportEndpoints which in turn calls WsdlExporter.ExportEndpoint for each endpoint. The endpoint is exported by first exporting its contract.When exporting a contract the System.ServiceModel.Description.WsdlExporter calls the IWsdlExportExtension.ExportContract method on all IWsdlExportExtension implementations on the contract, and operation behaviors for that contract. Operations that use wildcard actions are not exported in metadata, so IWsdlExportExtension implementations on operation behaviors for these operations are not exported. After exporting the contract, the port and binding are exported and exported policy expressions are attached. Both the ExportContract and the ExportEndpoint methods provide access to the WsdlExporter so that IWsdlExportExtension implementations can report recoverable errors and warnings through the Errors property. The context objects passed into both methods provide convenient mappings from exported WSDL elements to properties of ContractDescription and ServiceEndpoint objects. If an IWsdlExportExtension implementation throws an exception on export, the generated metadata is in an inconsistent state and the WsdlExporter object should be discarded.

2275,33691,460076,463820,8,public abstract class BaseRowSet   ,"An abstract class providing a RowSet object with its basic functionality.  The basic functions include having properties and sending event  notifications, which all JavaBeansTM components must implement.   1.0 Overview  The BaseRowSet class provides the core functionality for all RowSet  implementations, and all standard implementations may use this class in  combination with one or more RowSet interfaces in order to provide a  standard vendor-specific implementation. To clarify, all implementations  must implement at least one of the RowSet interfaces (JdbcRowSet,  CachedRowSet, JoinRowSet, FilteredRowSet, or WebRowSet). This means that  any implementation that extends the BaseRowSet class must also implement  one of the RowSet interfaces.  The BaseRowSet class provides the following:      * Properties           o Fields for storing current properties           o Methods for getting and setting properties      * Event notification      * A complete set of setter methods for setting the parameters in a        RowSet object's command      * Streams           o Fields for storing stream instances           o Constants for indicating the type of a stream   2.0 Setting Properties  All rowsets maintain a set of properties, which will usually be set using a  tool. The number and kinds of properties a rowset has will vary, depending  on what the RowSet implementation does and how it gets its data. For  example, rowsets that get their data from a ResultSet object need to set  the properties that are required for making a database connection. If a  RowSet object uses the DriverManager facility to make a connection, it  needs to set a property for the JDBC URL that identifies the appropriate  driver, and it needs to set the properties that give the user name and  password. If, on the other hand, the rowset uses a DataSource object to  make the connection, which is the preferred method, it does not need to set  the property for the JDBC URL. Instead, it needs to set the property for  the logical name of the data source along with the properties for the user  name and password.  NOTE: In order to use a DataSource object for making a connection, the  DataSource object must have been registered with a naming service that uses  the Java Naming and Directory InterfaceTM (JNDI) API. This registration is  usually done by a person acting in the capacity of a system administrator.   3.0 Setting the Command and Its Parameters  When a rowset gets its data from a relational database, it executes a  command (a query) that produces a ResultSet object. This query is the  command that is set for the RowSet object's command property. The rowset  populates itself with data by reading the data from the ResultSet object  into itself. If the query contains placeholders for values to be set, the  BaseRowSet setter methods are used to set these values. All setter methods  allow these values to be set to null if required.  The following code fragment illustrates how the CachedRowSetTM object crs  might have its command property set. Note that if a tool is used to set  properties, this is the code that the tool would use.   crs.setCommand(SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS + WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > ? AND REGION = ?);   In this example, the values for CREDIT_LIMIT and REGION are placeholder  parameters, which are indicated with a question mark (?). The first  question mark is placeholder parameter number 1, the second question mark  is placeholder parameter number 2, and so on. Any placeholder parameters  must be set with values before the query can be executed. To set these  placeholder parameters, the BaseRowSet class provides a set of setter  methods, similar to those provided by the PreparedStatement interface, for  setting values of each data type. A RowSet object stores the parameter  values internally, and its execute method uses them internally to set  values for the placeholder parameters before it sends the command to the  DBMS to be executed.  The following code fragment demonstrates setting the two parameters in the  query from the previous example.   crs.setInt(1, 5000); crs.setString(2, West);   If the execute method is called at this point, the query sent to the DBMS  will be:   SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS + WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > 5000 AND REGION = 'West'   NOTE: Setting Array, Clob, Blob and Ref objects as a command parameter,  stores these values as SerialArray, SerialClob, SerialBlob and SerialRef  objects respectively.   4.0 Handling of Parameters Behind the Scenes  NOTE: The BaseRowSet class provides two kinds of setter methods, those that  set properties and those that set placeholder parameters. The setter  methods discussed in this section are those that set placeholder  parameters.  The placeholder parameters set with the BaseRowSet setter methods are  stored as objects in an internal Hashtable object. Primitives are stored as  their Object type. For example, byte is stored as Byte object, and int is  stored as an Integer object. When the method execute is called, the values  in the Hashtable object are substituted for the appropriate placeholder  parameters in the command. <P)> A call to the method getParams returns the  values stored in the Hashtable object as an array of Object instances. An  element in this array may be a simple Object instance or an array (which is  a type of Object). The particular setter method used determines whether an  element in this array is an Object or an array.  The majority of methods for setting placeholder parameters take two  parameters, with the first parameter indicating which placeholder parameter  is to be set, and the second parameter giving the value to be set. Methods  such as getInt, getString, getBoolean, and getLong fall into this category.  After these methods have been called, a call to the method getParams will  return an array with the values that have been set. Each element in the  array is an Object instance representing the values that have been set. The  order of these values in the array is determined by the int (the first  parameter) passed to the setter method. The values in the array are the  values (the second parameter) passed to the setter method. In other words,  the first element in the array is the value to be set for the first  placeholder parameter in the RowSet object's command. The second element is  the value to be set for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.  Several setter methods send the driver and DBMS information beyond the  value to be set. When the method getParams is called after one of these  setter methods has been used, the elements in the array will themselves be  arrays to accommodate the additional information. In this category, the  method setNull is a special case because one version takes only two  parameters (setNull(int parameterIndex, int SqlType)). Nevertheless, it  requires an array to contain the information that will be passed to the  driver and DBMS. The first element in this array is the value to be set,  which is null, and the second element is the int supplied for sqlType,  which indicates the type of SQL value that is being set to null. This  information is needed by some DBMSs and is therefore required in order to  ensure that applications are portable. The other version is intended to be  used when the value to be set to null is a user-defined type. It takes  three parameters (setNull(int parameterIndex, int sqlType, String typeName) ) and also requires an array to contain the information to be passed to the  driver and DBMS. The first two elements in this array are the same as for  the first version of setNull. The third element, typeName, gives the SQL  name of the user-defined type. As is true with the other setter methods,  the number of the placeholder parameter to be set is indicated by an  element's position in the array returned by getParams. So, for example, if  the parameter supplied to setNull is 2, the second element in the array  returned by getParams will be an array of two or three elements.  Some methods, such as setObject and setDate have versions that take more  than two parameters, with the extra parameters giving information to the  driver or the DBMS. For example, the methods setDate, setTime, and  setTimestamp can take a Calendar object as their third parameter. If the  DBMS does not store time zone information, the drivern uses the Calendar  object to construct the Date, Time, or Timestamp object being set. As is  true with other methods that provide additional information, the element in  the array returned by getParams is an array instead of a simple Object  instance.  The methods setAsciiStream, setBinaryStream, setCharacterStream, and  setUnicodeStream (which is deprecated, so applications should use  getCharacterStream instead) take three parameters, so for them, the element  in the array returned by getParams is also an array. What is different  about these setter methods is that in addition to the information provided  by parameters, the array contains one of the BaseRowSet constants  indicating the type of stream being set.  NOTE: The method getParams is called internally by RowSet implementations  extending this class; it is not normally called by an application  programmer directly.   5.0 Event Notification  The BaseRowSet class provides the event notification mechanism for rowsets.  It contains the field listeners, methods for adding and removing listeners,  and methods for notifying listeners of changes.  A listener is an object that has implemented the RowSetListener interface.  If it has been added to a RowSet object's list of listeners, it will be  notified when an event occurs on that RowSet object. Each listener's  implementation of the RowSetListener methods defines what that object will  do when it is notified that an event has occurred.  There are three possible events for a RowSet object:     1. the cursor moves    2. an individual row is changed (updated, deleted, or inserted)    3. the contents of the entire RowSet object are changed  The BaseRowSet method used for the notification indicates the type of event  that has occurred. For example, the method notifyRowChanged indicates that  a row has been updated, deleted, or inserted. Each of the notification  methods creates a RowSetEvent object, which is supplied to the listener in  order to identify the RowSet object on which the event occurred. What the  listener does with this information, which may be nothing, depends on how  it was implemented.   6.0 Default Behavior  A default BaseRowSet object is initialized with many starting values. The  following is true of a default RowSet instance that extends the BaseRowSet  class:     * Has a scrollable cursor and does not show changes made by others.     * Is updatable.     * Does not show rows that have been deleted.     * Has no time limit for how long a driver may take to execute the        RowSet object's command.     * Has no limit for the number of rows it may contain.     * Has no limit for the number of bytes a column may contain. NOTE: This       limit applies only to columns that hold values of the following       types: BINARY, VARBINARY, LONGVARBINARY, CHAR, VARCHAR, and        LONGVARCHAR.     * Will not see uncommitted data (make dirty reads).     * Has escape processing turned on.     * Has its connection's type map set to null.     * Has an empty Vector object for storing the values set for the       placeholder parameters in the RowSet object's command.  If other values are desired, an application must set the property values  explicitly. For example, the following line of code sets the maximum number  of rows for the CachedRowSet object crs to 500.   crs.setMaxRows(500);   Methods implemented in extensions of this BaseRowSet class must throw an  SQLException object for any violation of the defined assertions. Also, if  the extending class overrides and reimplements any BaseRowSet method and  encounters connectivity or underlying data source issues, that method may  in addition throw an SQLException object for that reason.

2287,32275,440028,443772,8,public class Raster   ,"A class representing a rectangular array of pixels. A Raster encapsulates a  DataBuffer that stores the sample values and a SampleModel that describes  how to locate a given sample value in a DataBuffer.  A Raster defines values for pixels occupying a particular rectangular area  of the plane, not necessarily including (0, 0). The rectangle, known as the  Raster's bounding rectangle and available by means of the getBounds method,  is defined by minX, minY, width, and height values. The minX and minY  values define the coordinate of the upper left corner of the Raster.  References to pixels outside of the bounding rectangle may result in an  exception being thrown, or may result in references to unintended elements  of the Raster's associated DataBuffer. It is the user's responsibility to  avoid accessing such pixels.  A SampleModel describes how samples of a Raster are stored in the primitive  array elements of a DataBuffer. Samples may be stored one per data element,  as in a PixelInterleavedSampleModel or BandedSampleModel, or packed several  to an element, as in a SinglePixelPackedSampleModel or  MultiPixelPackedSampleModel. The SampleModel is also controls whether  samples are sign extended, allowing unsigned data to be stored in signed  Java data types such as byte, short, and int.  Although a Raster may live anywhere in the plane, a SampleModel makes use  of a simple coordinate system that starts at (0, 0). A Raster therefore  contains a translation factor that allows pixel locations to be mapped  between the Raster's coordinate system and that of the SampleModel. The  translation from the SampleModel coordinate system to that of the Raster  may be obtained by the getSampleModelTranslateX and  getSampleModelTranslateY methods.  A Raster may share a DataBuffer with another Raster either by explicit  construction or by the use of the createChild and createTranslatedChild  methods. Rasters created by these methods can return a reference to the  Raster they were created from by means of the getParent method. For a  Raster that was not constructed by means of a call to createTranslatedChild  or createChild, getParent will return null.  The createTranslatedChild method returns a new Raster that shares all of  the data of the current Raster, but occupies a bounding rectangle of the  same width and height but with a different starting point. For example, if  the parent Raster occupied the region (10, 10) to (100, 100), and the  translated Raster was defined to start at (50, 50), then pixel (20, 20) of  the parent and pixel (60, 60) of the child occupy the same location in the  DataBuffer shared by the two Rasters. In the first case, (-10, -10) should  be added to a pixel coordinate to obtain the corresponding SampleModel  coordinate, and in the second case (-50, -50) should be added.  The translation between a parent and child Raster may be determined by  subtracting the child's sampleModelTranslateX and sampleModelTranslateY  values from those of the parent.  The createChild method may be used to create a new Raster occupying only a  subset of its parent's bounding rectangle (with the same or a translated  coordinate system) or with a subset of the bands of its parent.  All constructors are protected. The correct way to create a Raster is to  use one of the static create methods defined in this class. These methods  create instances of Raster that use the standard Interleaved, Banded, and  Packed SampleModels and that may be processed more efficiently than a  Raster created by combining an externally generated SampleModel and  DataBuffer.

Summary: Represents the method that will handle a CellParsing event of a DataGridView. Remarks: Handle the CellParsing event to provide custom value conversion from a user-specified value to a value in the type specified by the cell ValueType property. When you handle the CellParsing event, you can convert the value yourself or you can customize the default conversion. For example, you can convert the value yourself using the cell ParseFormattedValue method with type converters of your choosing. Alternatively, you can let the default type converters parse the value, but modify the NullValue, DataSourceNullValue, and FormatProvider properties of the object returned by the DataGridViewCellParsingEventArgs.InheritedCellStyle property, which is initialized using the cell InheritedStyle property. When you convert the value yourself, replace the initial, formatted value of the ConvertEventArgs.Value property with the converted value in the type specified by the cell ValueType property. To indicate that no further parsing is necessary, set the DataGridViewCellParsingEventArgs.ParsingApplied property to true. When the event handler completes, if the Value is Nothing or is not of the correct type, or the ParsingApplied property is false, the Value is parsed using the cell ParseFormattedValue method with default type converters. The default implementation of this method parses the value using the NullValue, DataSourceNullValue, and FormatProvider properties of the cell style passed in. If the value is not equal to NullValue, the value is parsed using the FormatProvider property and the type converters passed in. To customize the conversion of a cell value into a formatted value for display, handle the CellFormatting event. For more information about handling events, see Consuming Events. When you create a DataGridViewCellParsingEventHandler delegate, you identify the method that will handle the event. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The event handler is called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the delegate. For more information about event-handler delegates, see Events and Delegates.

This class exists only as a convenience for creating  listener objects.  Extend this class to create a DropTargetEvent listener and override the  methods for the events of interest. (If you implement the  DropTargetListener interface, you have to define all of the methods in it.  This abstract class defines a null implementation for every method except  drop(DropTargetDropEvent), so you only have to define methods for events  you care about.) You must provide an implementation for at least  drop(DropTargetDropEvent). This method cannot have a null implementation  because its specification requires that you either accept or reject the  drop, and, if accepted, indicate whether the drop was successful.  Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with  a DropTarget. When the drag enters, moves over, or exits the operable part  of the drop site for that DropTarget, when the drop action changes, and  when the drop occurs, the relevant method in the listener object is  invoked, and the DropTargetEvent is passed to it.  The operable part of the drop site for the DropTarget is the part of the  associated Component's geometry that is not obscured by an overlapping  top-level window or by another Component higher in the Z-order that has an  associated active DropTarget.

Remarks: Within any given chart, the inner plot position is the rectangular area, inside the x and y-axis lines, where the data points are drawn. The plot position is the rectangular area that encompasses the inner plot position, the tick marks, and the axis labels. The chart area is the rectangular area that encompasses the plot position, the tick marks, the axis labels and the axis titles on the chart. A chart area is represented by a ChartArea class; ChartArea objects are stored in the ChartAreaCollection class. The number of chart series that can be plotted in a chart area is unlimited. A ChartArea object: Uses one distinct inner plotting area. Is used to plot one or more chart series. Has primary and secondary x and y-axes, except for pie and doughnut chart types. When you use Shape chart types, which includes pie, doughnut, funnel, pyramid, polar, and radar charts, the inner plotting position defines the size of the chart type shape. For example, when you increase the value of the InnerPlotPosition property on a pie chart, you will increase the radius of the pie shape. For all other chart types, each chart area has two sets of X- and Y-axes, primary and secondary. To access properties related to these axes, use the AxisX, AxisX2, AxisY and AxisY2 properties. If you need to set a property that affects all axes on the chart, use the Axes property. One or more series are associated with a chart area. The series has a ChartArea property that determines the chart area that each series belongs to. By default, the series is connected to the default chart area. To disable the display of a series, set the ChartArea property of that series to a zero-length string. If another chart area is added to the chart, you can associate any series with the new chart area. In all Shape chart types, as well as bar and stacked bar chart types, each series must be plotted in a separate chart area. In all other chart types, multiple series can be combined in the same chart area. A 3D chart is displayed on a chart area-by-chart area basis. You can use the Area3DStyle property to enable and customize your chart in 3D. The chart area minimum and maximum will not be automatically recalculated if you add new data, so the chart will not automatically change axis sizes.  You can require the chart area to recalculate these values by using the RecalculateAxesScale method. To align multiple chart areas vertically, set the AlignmentOrientation property. To align multiple chart areas horizontally, you must first position the chart areas using the Position property, and then set the AlignmentOrientation property to Horizontal.

Remarks: Windows Forms includes built-in accessibility support that allows your application to work with accessibility client applications. Examples of accessibility client applications include screen enlarger and reviewer utilities, voice input utilities, on-screen keyboards, alternative input devices, and keyboard enhancement utilities. The DataGridViewLinkCell.DataGridViewLinkCellAccessibleObject class inherits from the AccessibleObject class to provide information about a DataGridViewLinkCell to accessibility client applications. Each class that represents a visual part of the DataGridView-such as DataGridViewColumnHeaderCell, DataGridViewRowHeaderCell, DataGridViewRow and DataGridViewCell-also contains a class that inherits from AccessibleObject to provide information about the containing class and perform actions on behalf of accessibility client applications. There are instances when you will want to provide additional information, such as the name or description of the DataGridView control, to accessibility client applications. There are two ways of providing this additional information. To provide limited accessibility information for existing controls, set the control's AccessibleName and AccessibleDescription property values, which will be reported to accessibility client applications. Note You should change the AccessibleDefaultActionDescription and AccessibleRole property values only in rare situations, such as if you make a DataGridView look like a list. Occasionally, you might require more accessibility information or different accessibility actions to be included with your custom DataGridView or DataGridViewCell. To customize accessibility, you can write your own class that derives from the DataGridView.DataGridViewAccessibleObject or DataGridViewCell.DataGridViewCellAccessibleObject classes and override the CreateAccessibilityInstance method. For example, if you are writing a custom row header cell that implements unique custom actions, such as special hit testing within your cell, you should create a class that inherits from the DataGridViewRowHeaderCell.DataGridViewRowHeaderCellAccessibleObject class and override the CreateAccessibilityInstance method. The DataGridView exposes its data structure by using AccessibleRole values to define the data table hierarchy.

If  you have an interface that contains only getter methods (such as String  getName() or boolean isActive()) then you can use this class in conjunction  with the Proxy class to produce an implementation of the interface where  each getter returns the value of the corresponding item in a CompositeData .  For example, suppose you have an interface like this:       public interface NamedNumber { public int getNumber(); public String getName(); }   and a CompositeData constructed like this:       CompositeData cd = new CompositeDataSupport( someCompositeType, new String[] {number, name}, new Object[] {5, five} );   then you can construct an object implementing NamedNumber and backed by the  object cd like this:       InvocationHandler handler = new CompositeDataInvocationHandler(cd); NamedNumber nn = (NamedNumber) Proxy.newProxyInstance(NamedNumber.class.getClassLoader(), new Class[] {NamedNumber.class}, handler);   A call to nn.getNumber() will then return 5.  If the first letter of the property defined by a getter is a capital, then  this handler will look first for an item in the CompositeData beginning  with a capital, then, if that is not found, for an item beginning with the  corresponding lowercase letter or code point. For a getter called  getNumber(), the handler will first look for an item called Number, then  for number. If the getter is called getnumber(), then the item must be  called number.

If the method given to  invoke is the method int hashCode() inherited from Object, then it will  return a value that is consistent with this definition of equals: if two  objects are equal according to equals, then they will have the same  hashCode.

Character buffers can be created either by allocation, which allocates  space for the buffer's content, by wrapping an existing character array or  string into a buffer, or by creating a view of an existing byte buffer.  Like a byte buffer, a character buffer is either direct or non-direct. A  character buffer created via the wrap methods of this class will be  non-direct. A character buffer created as a view of a byte buffer will be  direct if, and only if, the byte buffer itself is direct. Whether or not a  character buffer is direct may be determined by invoking the isDirect  method.  This class implements the CharSequence interface so that character buffers  may be used wherever character sequences are accepted, for example in the  regular-expression package java.util.regex.  Methods in this class that do not otherwise have a value to return are  specified to return the buffer upon which they are invoked. This allows  method invocations to be chained.

A line is  an element of the digital audio pipeline, such as a mixer, an input or  output port, or a data path into or out of a mixer.  A line can have controls, such as gain, pan, and reverb. The controls  themselves are instances of classes that extend the base Control class. The  Line interface provides two accessor methods for obtaining the line's  controls: getControls returns the entire set, and getControl returns a  single control of specified type.  Lines exist in various states at different times. When a line opens, it  reserves system resources for itself, and when it closes, these resources  are freed for other objects or applications. The isOpen() method lets you  discover whether a line is open or closed. An open line need not be  processing data, however. Such processing is typically initiated by  subinterface methods such as SourceDataLine.write and TargetDataLine.read.  You can register an object to receive notifications whenever the line's  state changes. The object must implement the LineListener interface, which  consists of the single method update. This method will be invoked when a  line opens and closes (and, if it's a DataLine, when it starts and stops).  An object can be registered to listen to multiple lines. The event it  receives in its update method will specify which line created the event,  what type of event it was (OPEN, CLOSE, START, or STOP), and how many  sample frames the line had processed at the time the event occurred.

This  could be used to spoof the system, since the program is in direct control  of rendering. listenToAllAWTEvents 	Listen to all AWT events, system-wide 	After adding  an AWT event listener, malicious code may scan all AWT events dispatched in  the system, allowing it to read all user input (such as passwords). Each  AWT event listener is called from within the context of that event queue's  EventDispatchThread, so if the accessEventQueue permission is also enabled,  malicious code could modify the contents of AWT event queues system-wide,  causing the application or applet to misbehave in an insecure manner. readDisplayPixels 	Readback of pixels from the display screen 	Interfaces  such as the java.awt.Composite interface or the java.awt.Robot class allow  arbitrary code to examine pixels on the display enable malicious code to  snoop on the activities of the user. replaceKeyboardFocusManager 	Sets the KeyboardFocusManager for a particular  thread. 	When SecurityManager is installed, the invoking thread must be  granted this permission in order to replace the current  KeyboardFocusManager. If permission is not granted, a SecurityException  will be thrown. setAppletStub 	Setting the stub which implements Applet container services 	 Malicious code could set an applet's stub and result in unexpected behavior  or denial of service to an applet. setWindowAlwaysOnTop 	Setting always-on-top property of the window:  Window.setAlwaysOnTop(boolean) 	The malicious window might make itself look  and behave like a real full desktop, so that information entered by the  unsuspecting user is captured and subsequently misused showWindowWithoutWarningBanner 	Display of a window without also displaying  a banner warning that the window was created by an applet 	Without this  warning, an applet may pop up windows without the user knowing that they  belong to an applet. Since users may make security-sensitive decisions  based on whether or not the window belongs to an applet (entering a  username and password into a dialog box, for example), disabling this  warning banner may allow applets to trick the user into entering such  information. toolkitModality 	Creating TOOLKIT_MODAL dialogs and setting the  TOOLKIT_EXCLUDE window property. 	When a toolkit-modal dialog is shown from  an applet, it blocks all other applets in the browser. When launching  applications from Java Web Start, its windows (such as the security dialog)  may also be blocked by toolkit-modal dialogs, shown from these  applications. watchMousePointer 	Getting the information about the mouse pointer position  at any time 	Constantly watching the mouse pointer, an applet can make  guesses about what the user is doing, i.e. moving the mouse to the lower  left corner of the screen most likely means that the user is about to  launch an application. If a virtual keypad is used so that keyboard is  emulated using the mouse, an applet may guess what is being typed.

2348,32394,442852,446596,8,public class SecurityManager   ,"The security manager is a class that allows applications to implement a  security policy. It allows an application to determine, before performing a  possibly unsafe or sensitive operation, what the operation is and whether  it is being attempted in a security context that allows the operation to be  performed. The application can allow or disallow the operation.  The SecurityManager class contains many methods with names that begin with  the word check. These methods are called by various methods in the Java  libraries before those methods perform certain potentially sensitive  operations. The invocation of such a check method typically looks like  this:       SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager(); if (security != null) { security.checkXXX(argument,  . . . ); }   The security manager is thereby given an opportunity to prevent completion  of the operation by throwing an exception. A security manager routine  simply returns if the operation is permitted, but throws a  SecurityException if the operation is not permitted. The only exception to  this convention is checkTopLevelWindow, which returns a boolean value.  The current security manager is set by the setSecurityManager method in  class System. The current security manager is obtained by the  getSecurityManager method.  The special method checkPermission(java.security.Permission) determines  whether an access request indicated by a specified permission should be  granted or denied.

2356,38021,220628,223577,7,System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection,"Additional online Documentation: Syntax: public sealed class SqlConnection : DbConnection, ICloneable Summary: Represents an open connection to a SQL Server database. This class cannot be inherited. Remarks: A SqlConnection object represents a unique session to a SQL Server data source. With a client/server database system, it is equivalent to a network connection to the server. SqlConnection is used together with SqlDataAdapter and SqlCommand to increase performance when connecting to a Microsoft SQL Server database. For all third-party SQL server products, and other OLE DB-supported data sources, use OleDbConnection. When you create an instance of SqlConnection, all properties are set to their initial values. For a list of these values, see the SqlConnection constructor. See ConnectionString for a list of the keywords in a connection string. If the SqlConnection goes out of scope, it won't be closed. Therefore, you must explicitly close the connection by calling Close or Dispose. Close and Dispose are functionally equivalent. If the connection pooling value Pooling is set to true or yes, the underlying connection is returned back to the connection pool. On the other hand, if Pooling is set to false or no, the underlying connection to the server is actually closed. Note Login and logout events will not be raised on the server when a connection is fetched from or returned to the connection pool, because the connection is not actually closed when it is returned to the connection pool. For more information, see SQL Server Connection Pooling (ADO.NET). To ensure that connections are always closed, open the connection inside of a using block, as shown in the following code fragment. Doing so ensures that the connection is automatically closed when the code exits the block.  Note To deploy high-performance applications, you must use connection pooling. When you use the .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server, you do not have to enable connection pooling because the provider manages this automatically, although you can modify some settings. For more information, see SQL Server Connection Pooling (ADO.NET). If a SqlException is generated by the method executing a SqlCommand, the SqlConnection remains open when the severity level is 19 or less. When the severity level is 20 or greater, the server ordinarily closes the SqlConnection. However, the user can reopen the connection and continue. An application that creates an instance of the SqlConnection object can require all direct and indirect callers to have sufficient permission to the code by setting declarative or imperative security demands. SqlConnection makes security demands using the SqlClientPermission object. Users can verify that their code has sufficient permissions by using the SqlClientPermissionAttribute object. Users and administrators can also use the Caspol.exe (Code Access Security Policy Tool) to modify security policy at the machine, user, and enterprise levels. For more information, see Security in the .NET Framework. For an example demonstrating how to use security demands, see Code Access Security and ADO.NET. Note If you are using Microsoft .NET Framework version 1.0, the FullTrust named permission set is required to connect to SQL Server by using Open. This requirement does not apply if you are using .NET Framework version 1.1 or later. For more information, see Requesting Permissions and Named Permission Sets. For more information about handling warning and informational messages from the server, see Connection Events (ADO.NET). SQL Server engine errors and error messages are documented in SQL Server Books Online. Caution ADO.NET 2.0 does not support Asynchronous commands over shared memory for SQL Server 2000 or lower. However, you can force TCP instead of shared memory. You can do that by prefixing tcp: to the server name in the connection string or you can use localhost.

Return Value Type: System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject An AccessibleObject that represents one of the AccessibleNavigation values. Summary: Navigates to another accessible object. Remarks: Navigation, both spatial and logical, is always restricted to the user interface elements within a container. With spatial navigation, clients can navigate only to a sibling of the starting object. Depending on the navigational flag used with logical navigation, clients can navigate to either a child or to a sibling of the starting object. This method does not change the selection or focus. To change the focus or to select an object, use Select. The Navigate method retrieves only user interface elements that have a defined screen location. Notes to Inheritors All visual objects must support this method. If an object has the state AccessibleStates.Invisible, navigation to this hidden object might fail. Some system-defined interface elements such as menus, menu items, and pop-up menus allow navigation to objects that are not visible. However, other system-defined user interface elements do not support this. If possible, servers should support navigation to objects that are not visible, but this support is not required and clients should not expect it. Example: The following example demonstrates the creation of an accessibility-aware chart control, using the AccessibleObject and Control.ControlAccessibleObject classes to expose accessible information. The control plots two curves along with a legend. The ChartControlAccessibleObject class, which derives from ControlAccessibleObject, is used in the CreateAccessibilityInstance method to provide custom accessible information for the chart control. Since the chart legend is not an actual Control -based control, but instead is drawn by the chart control, it does not have any built-in accessible information. Because of this, the ChartControlAccessibleObject class overrides the GetChild method to return the CurveLegendAccessibleObject that represents accessible information for each part of the legend. When an accessible-aware application uses this control, the control can provide the necessary accessible information. This code demonstrates shows overriding the Navigate method.

Remarks: ASP.NET provides session-state management to enable you to store information associated with a unique browser session across multiple requests. You can store a collection of values referenced by a key name or by numerical index. Access to session values and functionality is available using the HttpSessionState class, which is accessible through the Session property of the current HttpContext or the Session property of the Page. The HttpSessionState class accesses session-state values and session-level settings by referencing a session-state container, which is an implementation of the IHttpSessionState interface that has been populated with session-state data and added to the HttpContext of the current request by the session-state module for the HttpApplication. The HttpSessionState class calls the HttpSessionStateContainer class, which manages session settings and values in memory. The HttpSessionStateContainer class is the ASP.NET implementation of the IHttpSessionState interface. The HttpSessionStateContainer class is not intended to be called from application code. If you replace the SessionStateModule with a custom session-state module, you can use the HttpSessionStateContainer class, or supply your own implementation of the IHttpSessionState interface.

Remarks: The GridTableStylesCollection contains DataGridTableStyle objects that allows the DataGrid control to display a customized grid style for each DataTable in a DataSet. On the DataGrid control, the TableStyles property returns the GridTableStylesCollection. By default, the GridTableStylesCollection does not contain any DataGridTableStyle objects. Instead, the DataGrid displays each table using default settings for color, width, and formatting. All columns of each table are displayed. When a DataGridTableStyle is added to the collection, the DataGrid uses the MappingName to determine which object supplies the data for the grid. For example, if the data source is a DataSet that contains three DataTable objects, the MappingName must match the TableName of one of the objects. If the MappingName does not match any of the TableName values, the default settings will be used to display data for each table, and the DataGridTableStyle settings will be ignored. Caution Always create DataGridColumnStyle objects and add them to the GridColumnStylesCollection before adding DataGridTableStyle objects to the GridTableStylesCollection. When you add an empty DataGridTableStyle with a valid MappingName value to the collection, DataGridColumnStyle objects are automatically generated for you. Consequently, an exception will be thrown if you try to add new DataGridColumnStyle objects with duplicate MappingName values to the GridColumnStylesCollection. Alternatively, clear the GridColumnStylesCollection using the Clear method.

Remarks: Use this attribute to designate a class as an entity class that is associated with a database table or view. LINQ to SQL treats classes that have the TableAttribute attribute as persistent classes. LINQ to SQL supports only single-table mapping. That is, an entity class must be mapped to exactly one database table, and you cannot map a database table to multiple classes at the same time. You can use the Name property of the TableAttribute attribute to specify a name for the table, and you can optionally use the schema name to qualify a table name. If you do not specify a name by using the Name property, the table name is assumed to be the same as the class name. Schema-qualified Names You can optionally use the schema name to qualify a table name. By default, the token to the left of the first period in the Name string is considered to be the schema name. The remainder of the name is considered to be the table name. The provider quotes the table name as appropriate. For example, the LINQ to SQL provider for SQL Server makes sure that brackets are used at least where they are needed. Note In some cases, you must explicitly quote attributes because the SQL Server provider cannot auto-quote. The following table shows some examples. Case Example: Identifier Name Example: Expected String in Attributes Otherwise. Schema name contains a period Schema: #A.B# Table: #C# #[A.B].C# The first period is assumed to separate the schema name from the table name. Schema/Table name starts with @ #@SomeName# #[@SomeName]# Assumed to be a parameter name. Schema starts with [ and ends with ] #[Schema.Table]# #[[Schema].[Table]]]# The unquoted identifier resembles a quoted identifier.

2433,33715,464215,467959,8,public class JViewport   ,"The viewport or porthole through which you see the underlying  information. When you scroll, what moves is the viewport. It is like  peering through a camera's viewfinder. Moving the viewfinder upwards brings  new things into view at the top of the picture and loses things that were  at the bottom.  By default, JViewport is opaque. To change this, use the setOpaque method.  NOTE:We have implemented a faster scrolling algorithm that does not require  a buffer to draw in. The algorithm works as follows:     1. The view and parent view and checked to see if they are JComponents,       if they aren't, stop and repaint the whole viewport.    2. If the viewport is obscured by an ancestor, stop and repaint the       whole viewport.    3. Compute the region that will become visible, if it is as big as the       viewport, stop and repaint the whole view region.    4. Obtain the ancestor Window's graphics and do a copyArea on the       scrolled region.    5. Message the view to repaint the newly visible region.    6. The next time paint is invoked on the viewport, if the clip region is       smaller than the viewport size a timer is kicked off to repaint the       whole region. In general this approach is much faster. Compared to the backing store  approach this avoids the overhead of maintaining an offscreen buffer and  having to do two copyAreas. Compared to the non backing store case this  approach will greatly reduce the painted region.  This approach can cause slower times than the backing store approach when  the viewport is obscured by another window, or partially offscreen. When  another window obscures the viewport the copyArea will copy garbage and a  paint event will be generated by the system to inform us we need to paint  the newly exposed region. The only way to handle this is to repaint the  whole viewport, which can cause slower performance than the backing store  case. In most applications very rarely will the user be scrolling while the  viewport is obscured by another window or offscreen, so this optimization  is usually worth the performance hit when obscured.

For example, a third-tier  server might not be accessible, or there may be insufficient memory or disk  storage to handle requests. A system administrator may need to take  corrective action.  Servlet containers can safely treat both types of unavailable exceptions in  the same way. However, treating temporary unavailability effectively makes  the servlet container more robust.

Note In most cases you will be able to use the ASP.NET health-monitoring types as implemented, and you will control the health-monitoring system by specifying values in the healthMonitoring configuration section. You can also derive from the health-monitoring types to create your own custom events and providers. For an example of deriving from the WebManagementEvent class, see the example provided in this topic. Notes to Inheritors When formatting your custom event information for display, override the FormatCustomEventDetails method rather than the ToString method. This will avoid overwriting or tampering with sensitive system information. The event code you specify for your custom event must be greater than WebExtendedBase. Example: The following example shows how to implement a custom event by deriving it from the WebManagementEvent class.  The following is an excerpt of the configuration file that enables ASP.NET to use the custom event. ThreadSafety: Any public static (Shared in Visual Basic) members of this type are thread safe.

2466,32423,442817,446561,8,public void addShutdownHook(Thread hook),"Registers a new virtual-machine shutdown hook.  The Java virtual machine shuts down in response to two kinds of events:  * The program exits normally, when the last non-daemon thread exits or when the exit (equivalently, System.exit) method is invoked, or  * The virtual machine is terminated in response to a user interrupt, such as typing ^C, or a system-wide event, such as user logoff or system shutdown.  A shutdown hook is simply an initialized but unstarted thread. When the virtual machine begins its shutdown sequence it will start all registered shutdown hooks in some unspecified order and let them run concurrently. When all the hooks have finished it will then run all uninvoked finalizers if finalization-on-exit has been enabled. Finally, the virtual machine will halt. Note that daemon threads will continue to run during the shutdown sequence, as will non-daemon threads if shutdown was initiated by invoking the exit method.  Once the shutdown sequence has begun it can be stopped only by invoking the halt method, which forcibly terminates the virtual machine.  Once the shutdown sequence has begun it is impossible to register a new shutdown hook or de-register a previously-registered hook. Attempting either of these operations will cause an IllegalStateException to be thrown.  Shutdown hooks run at a delicate time in the life cycle of a virtual machine and should therefore be coded defensively. They should, in particular, be written to be thread-safe and to avoid deadlocks insofar as possible. They should also not rely blindly upon services that may have registered their own shutdown hooks and therefore may themselves in the process of shutting down. Attempts to use other thread-based services such as the AWT event-dispatch thread, for example, may lead to deadlocks.  Shutdown hooks should also finish their work quickly. When a program invokes exit the expectation is that the virtual machine will promptly shut down and exit. When the virtual machine is terminated due to user logoff or system shutdown the underlying operating system may only allow a fixed amount of time in which to shut down and exit. It is therefore inadvisable to attempt any user interaction or to perform a long-running computation in a shutdown hook.  Uncaught exceptions are handled in shutdown hooks just as in any other thread, by invoking the uncaughtException method of the thread's ThreadGroup object. The default implementation of this method prints the exception's stack trace to System.err and terminates the thread; it does not cause the virtual machine to exit or halt.  In rare circumstances the virtual machine may abort, that is, stop running without shutting down cleanly. This occurs when the virtual machine is terminated externally, for example with the SIGKILL signal on Unix or the TerminateProcess call on Microsoft Windows. The virtual machine may also abort if a native method goes awry by, for example, corrupting internal data structures or attempting to access nonexistent memory. If the virtual machine aborts then no guarantee can be made about whether or not any shutdown hooks will be run.  Parameters: hook - An initialized but unstarted Thread object Throws: IllegalArgumentException - If the specified hook has already been registered, or if it can be determined that the hook is already running or has already been run IllegalStateException - If the virtual machine is already in the process of shutting down SecurityException - If a security manager is present and it denies RuntimePermission(shutdownHooks) Since: 1.3 See Also: removeShutdownHook(java.lang.Thread), halt(int), exit(int)",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,8,584,mixed

Remarks: Claims are added to an EvaluationContext by authorization policies. An authorization policy takes a set of claims, such as those found in a security token, and adds additional claims based on the current set. For instance, an authorization policy might evaluate a claim that contains the date of birth and add a claim that states the user is over 21 years old and add an Over21 claim to the EvaluationContext. Classes that implement the IAuthorizationPolicy interface do not authorize users, but they enable the ServiceAuthorizationManager class to do so. The ServiceAuthorizationManager calls the Evaluate method for each authorization policy in effect. The Evaluate method determines whether additional claims should be added for the user based on the current claims. An authorization policy's Evaluate method may be called multiple times, as claims are added to the EvaluationContext by other authorization policies. When all authorization policies in effect are done, the ServiceAuthorizationManager class makes authorization decisions based upon the final set of claims. The ServiceAuthorizationManager class then creates an AuthorizationContext that contains an immutable set of claims that reflects these authorization decisions. An evaluation context contains a set of ClaimSet objects: an expiration time, which specifies the span of time during which the evaluation context is valid, and a unique identifier.

2482,33748,463668,467412,8,public class JTable   ,"The JTable is used to display and edit regular two-dimensional tables of  cells. See How to Use Tables in The Java Tutorial for task-oriented  documentation and examples of using JTable.  The JTable has many facilities that make it possible to customize its  rendering and editing but provides defaults for these features so that  simple tables can be set up easily. For example, to set up a table with 10  rows and 10 columns of numbers:   TableModel dataModel = new AbstractTableModel() { public int getColumnCount() { return 10; } public int getRowCount() { return 10;} public Object getValueAt(int row, int col) { return new Integer(row*col); } }; JTable table = new JTable(dataModel); JScrollPane scrollpane = new JScrollPane(table);   Note that if you wish to use a JTable in a standalone view (outside of a  JScrollPane) and want the header displayed, you can get it using  getTableHeader() and display it separately.  To enable sorting and filtering of rows, use a RowSorter. You can set up a  row sorter in either of two ways:      * Directly set the RowSorter. For example: table.setRowSorter(new       TableRowSorter(model)).     * Set the autoCreateRowSorter property to true, so that the JTable        creates a RowSorter for you. For example:        setAutoCreateRowSorter(true).  When designing applications that use the JTable it is worth paying close  attention to the data structures that will represent the table's data. The  DefaultTableModel is a model implementation that uses a Vector of Vectors  of Objects to store the cell values. As well as copying the data from an  application into the DefaultTableModel, it is also possible to wrap the  data in the methods of the TableModel interface so that the data can be  passed to the JTable directly, as in the example above. This often results  in more efficient applications because the model is free to choose the  internal representation that best suits the data. A good rule of thumb for  deciding whether to use the AbstractTableModel or the DefaultTableModel is  to use the AbstractTableModel as the base class for creating subclasses and  the DefaultTableModel when subclassing is not required.  The TableExample directory in the demo area of the source distribution  gives a number of complete examples of JTable usage, covering how the  JTable can be used to provide an editable view of data taken from a  database and how to modify the columns in the display to use specialized  renderers and editors.  The JTable uses integers exclusively to refer to both the rows and the  columns of the model that it displays. The JTable simply takes a tabular  range of cells and uses getValueAt(int, int) to retrieve the values from  the model during painting. It is important to remember that the column and  row indexes returned by various JTable methods are in terms of the JTable  (the view) and are not necessarily the same indexes used by the model.  By default, columns may be rearranged in the JTable so that the view's  columns appear in a different order to the columns in the model. This does  not affect the implementation of the model at all: when the columns are  reordered, the JTable maintains the new order of the columns internally and  converts its column indices before querying the model.  So, when writing a TableModel, it is not necessary to listen for column  reordering events as the model will be queried in its own coordinate system  regardless of what is happening in the view. In the examples area there is  a demonstration of a sorting algorithm making use of exactly this technique  to interpose yet another coordinate system where the order of the rows is  changed, rather than the order of the columns.  Similarly when using the sorting and filtering functionality provided by  RowSorter the underlying TableModel does not need to know how to do  sorting, rather RowSorter will handle it. Coordinate conversions will be  necessary when using the row based methods of JTable with the underlying  TableModel. All of JTables row based methods are in terms of the RowSorter , which is not necessarily the same as that of the underlying TableModel.  For example, the selection is always in terms of JTable so that when using  RowSorter you will need to convert using convertRowIndexToView or  convertRowIndexToModel. The following shows how to convert coordinates from  JTable to that of the underlying model:   int[] selection = table.getSelectedRows(); for (int i = 0; i < selection.length; i++) { selection[i] = table.convertRowIndexToModel(selection[i]); } // selection is now in terms of the underlying TableModel   By default if sorting is enabled JTable will persist the selection and  variable row heights in terms of the model on sorting. For example if row  0, in terms of the underlying model, is currently selected, after the sort  row 0, in terms of the underlying model will be selected. Visually the  selection may change, but in terms of the underlying model it will remain  the same. The one exception to that is if the model index is no longer  visible or was removed. For example, if row 0 in terms of model was  filtered out the selection will be empty after the sort.  J2SE 5 adds methods to JTable to provide convenient access to some common  printing needs. Simple new print() methods allow for quick and easy  addition of printing support to your application. In addition, a new  getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode, java.text.MessageFormat,  java.text.MessageFormat) method is available for more advanced printing  needs.  As for all JComponent classes, you can use InputMap and ActionMap to  associate an Action object with a KeyStroke and execute the action under  specified conditions.

Usage  @XmlElementRef annotation can be used with a JavaBean property or from  within XmlElementRefs  This annotation dynamically associates an XML element name with the  JavaBean property. When a JavaBean property is annotated with XmlElement,  the XML element name is statically derived from the JavaBean property name.  However, when this annotation is used, the XML element name is derived from  the instance of the type of the JavaBean property at runtime.   XML Schema substitution group support  XML Schema allows a XML document author to use XML element names that were  not statically specified in the content model of a schema using  substitution groups. Schema derived code provides support for substitution  groups using an element property, (section 5.5.5, Element Property of  JAXB 2.0 specification). An element property method signature is of the  form:   public void setTerm(JAXBElement<? extends Operator>); public JAXBElement<? extends Operator> getTerm();   An element factory method annotated with XmlElementDecl is used to create a  JAXBElement instance, containing an XML element name. The presence of  @XmlElementRef annotation on an element property indicates that the element  name from JAXBElement instance be used instead of deriving an XML element  name from the JavaBean property name.  The usage is subject to the following constraints:      * If the collection item type (for collection property) or property       type (for single valued property) is JAXBElement, then        @XmlElementRef}.name() and @XmlElementRef.namespace() must point an       element factory method with an @XmlElementDecl annotation in a class       annotated with @XmlRegistry (usually ObjectFactory class generated by       the schema compiler) :           o @XmlElementDecl.name() must equal @XmlElementRef.name()           o @XmlElementDecl.namespace() must equal             @XmlElementRef.namespace().     * If the collection item type (for collection property) or property       type (for single valued property) is not JAXBElement, then the type       referenced by the property or field must be annotated with        XmlRootElement.     * This annotation can be used with the following annotations:        XmlElementWrapper, XmlJavaTypeAdapter.  See Package Specification in javax.xml.bind.package javadoc for  additional common information.  Example 1: Ant Task Example  The following Java class hierarchy models an Ant build script. An Ant task  corresponds to a class in the class hierarchy. The XML element name of an  Ant task is indicated by the @XmlRootElement annotation on its  corresponding class.   @XmlRootElement(name=target) class Target { // The presence of @XmlElementRef indicates that the XML // element name will be derived from the @XmlRootElement // annotation on the type (for e.g. jar for JarTask). @XmlElementRef List<Task> tasks; }  abstract class Task { }  @XmlRootElement(name=jar) class JarTask extends Task { ... }  @XmlRootElement(name=javac) class JavacTask extends Task { ... }  <!-- XML Schema fragment --> <xs:element name=target type=Target> <xs:complexType name=Target> <xs:sequence> <xs:choice maxOccurs=unbounded> <xs:element ref=jar> <xs:element ref=javac> </xs:choice> </xs:sequence> </xs:complexType>    Thus the following code fragment:   Target target = new Target(); target.tasks.add(new JarTask()); target.tasks.add(new JavacTask()); marshal(target);   will produce the following XML output:     ....   ....     It is not an error to have a class that extends Task that doesn't have  XmlRootElement. But they can't show up in an XML instance (because they  don't have XML element names).  Example 2: XML Schema Susbstitution group support  The following example shows the annotations for XML Schema substitution  groups. The annotations and the ObjectFactory are derived from the schema.   @XmlElement class Math { //  The value of type()is //  JAXBElement.class , which indicates the XML //  element name ObjectFactory - in general a class marked //  with @XmlRegistry. (See ObjectFactory below) // //  The name() is operator, a pointer to a // factory method annotated with a //  XmlElementDecl with the name operator. Since //  operator is the head of a substitution group that //  contains elements add and sub elements, operator //  element can be substituted in an instance document by //  elements add or sub. At runtime, JAXBElement //  instance contains the element name that has been //  substituted in the XML document. // @XmlElementRef(type=JAXBElement.class,name=operator) JAXBElement<? extends Operator> term; }  @XmlRegistry class ObjectFactory { @XmlElementDecl(name=operator) JAXBElement<Operator> createOperator(Operator o) {...} @XmlElementDecl(name=add,substitutionHeadName=operator) JAXBElement<Operator> createAdd(Operator o) {...} @XmlElementDecl(name=sub,substitutionHeadName=operator) JAXBElement<Operator> createSub(Operator o) {...} }  class Operator { ... }   Thus, the following code fragment   Math m = new Math(); m.term = new ObjectFactory().createAdd(new Operator()); marshal(m);   will produce the following XML output:   <math> <add>...</add> </math>   Since:     JAXB2.0 Author:         * Kohsuke Kawaguchi, Sun Microsystems,Inc.         * Sekhar Vajjhala, Sun Microsystems, Inc.

2504,32066,434100,437844,8,public class Button   ,"This class creates a labeled button. The application can cause some action  to happen when the button is pushed. This image depicts three views of a  Quit button as it appears under the Solaris operating system:  [The following context describes the graphic]  The first view shows the button as it appears normally. The second view  shows the button when it has input focus. Its outline is darkened to let  the user know that it is an active object. The third view shows the button  when the user clicks the mouse over the button, and thus requests that an  action be performed.  The gesture of clicking on a button with the mouse is associated with one  instance of ActionEvent, which is sent out when the mouse is both pressed  and released over the button. If an application is interested in knowing  when the button has been pressed but not released, as a separate gesture,  it can specialize processMouseEvent, or it can register itself as a  listener for mouse events by calling addMouseListener. Both of these  methods are defined by Component, the abstract superclass of all  components.  When a button is pressed and released, AWT sends an instance of  ActionEvent to the button, by calling processEvent on the button. The  button's processEvent method receives all events for the button; it passes  an action event along by calling its own processActionEvent method. The  latter method passes the action event on to any action listeners that have  registered an interest in action events generated by this button.  If an application wants to perform some action based on a button being  pressed and released, it should implement ActionListener and register the  new listener to receive events from this button, by calling the button's  addActionListener method. The application can make use of the button's  action command as a messaging protocol.

Remarks: In a visual designer, when you switch from Source to Design view, the markup source code that describes the GridView control is parsed and a design-time version of the control is created on the design surface. When you switch back to Source view, the design-time control is persisted to the markup source code and edited into the markup for the Web page. The properties of the GridViewDesigner class provide the following functionality: The ActionLists property returns a DesignerActionListCollection object, which typically contains an object that is derived from the DesignerActionList class for each level in the inheritance tree of the designer. The AutoFormats property returns a collection of formatting schemes for display in the Auto Format dialog box. The TemplateGroups property returns a collection of template groups for the fields of the associated GridView control and the top-level GridView templates. The UsePreviewControl property always returns true, indicating that the designer creates a temporary copy of the associated GridView to generate the design-time markup. The methods of the GridViewDesigner class provide the following functionality: The DataBind method binds the associated GridView control to a design-time data source. The GetDesignTimeHtml method returns the markup that is used to render the associated GridView at design time. The Initialize method prepares the designer to view, edit, and design the associated GridView. The OnClick method is called when a region of the design-time view of the associated GridView is clicked. The OnSchemaRefreshed method is called when the schema of the data source of the associated GridView changes. The PreFilterProperties method is used to remove or add properties or to shadow properties of the associated GridView. Design-time editable regions are not supported in the GridView control, so the GetEditableDesignerRegionContent and SetEditableDesignerRegionContent methods have no functionality. Example: The following code example shows how to extend the GridViewDesigner class to change the appearance of controls that are derived from the GridView control at design time. The example derives the MyGridView control from the GridView. The MyGridView is simply a copy of the GridView. The example also derives the MyGridViewDesigner class from the GridViewDesigner class and places a DesignerAttribute object for the MyGridViewDesigner on the MyGridView control. The MyGridViewDesigner overrides the PreFilterProperties method to make the Page property visible in the Properties grid at design time. It overrides the GetDesignTimeHtml method to include the Caption property, if it is specified, as a new first row in the MyGridView control at design time. If the BorderStyle property of the MyGridView control has the NotSet or None value, the GetDesignTimeHtml draws a blue dashed border around the control to make its extent more visible.

Example: The following code example demonstrates the creation of an accessibility-aware chart control, using the AccessibleObject and Control.ControlAccessibleObject classes to expose accessible information. The control plots two curves along with a legend. The ChartControlAccessibleObject class, which derives from ControlAccessibleObject, is used in the CreateAccessibilityInstance method to provide custom accessible information for the chart control. Because the chart legend is not an actual Control -based control, but instead is drawn by the chart control, it does not any built-in accessible information. Because of this, the ChartControlAccessibleObject class overrides the GetChild method to return the CurveLegendAccessibleObject that represents accessible information for each part of the legend.

You can use the supplied role providers that are included with the .NET Framework, or you can implement your own provider. When implementing a custom role provider, you are required to inherit the RoleProvider abstract class. There are two primary reasons for creating a custom role provider. You need to store role information in a data source that is not supported by the role providers included with the .NET Framework, such as a FoxPro database, an Oracle database, or other data sources. You need to manage role information using a database schema that is different from the database schema used by the providers that ship with the .NET Framework.

For a rotating set of files, as each file reaches a given size limit, it is  closed, rotated out, and a new file opened. Successively older files are  named by adding 0, 1, 2, etc into the base filename.  By default buffering is enabled in the IO libraries but each log record is  flushed out when it is complete.  By default the XMLFormatter class is used for formatting.  Configuration: By default each FileHandler is initialized using the  following LogManager configuration properties. If properties are not  defined (or have invalid values) then the specified default values are  used.      * java.util.logging.FileHandler.level specifies the default level for       the Handler (defaults to Level.ALL).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.filter specifies the name of a Filter        class to use (defaults to no Filter).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter specifies the name of a        Formatter class to use (defaults to java.util.logging.XMLFormatter)     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.encoding the name of the character set       encoding to use (defaults to the default platform encoding).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.limit specifies an approximate maximum       amount to write (in bytes) to any one file. If this is zero, then       there is no limit. (Defaults to no limit).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.count specifies how many output files       to cycle through (defaults to 1).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern specifies a pattern for       generating the output file name. See below for details. (Defaults to       %h/java%u.log).     * java.util.logging.FileHandler.append specifies whether the       FileHandler should append onto any existing files (defaults to       false).  A pattern consists of a string that includes the following special  components that will be replaced at runtime:      * / the local pathname separator     * %t the system temporary directory     * %h the value of the user.home system property     * %g the generation number to distinguish rotated logs     * %u a unique number to resolve conflicts     * %% translates to a single percent sign % If no %g field has been specified and the file count is greater than one,  then the generation number will be added to the end of the generated  filename, after a dot.  Thus for example a pattern of %t/java%g.log with a count of 2 would  typically cause log files to be written on Solaris to /var/tmp/java0.log  and /var/tmp/java1.log whereas on Windows 95 they would be typically  written to C: TEMP java0.log and C: TEMP java1.log  Generation numbers follow the sequence 0, 1, 2, etc.  Normally the %u unique field is set to 0. However, if the FileHandler  tries to open the filename and finds the file is currently in use by  another process it will increment the unique number field and try again.  This will be repeated until FileHandler finds a file name that is not  currently in use. If there is a conflict and no %u field has been  specified, it will be added at the end of the filename after a dot. (This  will be after any automatically added generation number.)  Thus if three processes were all trying to log to fred%u.%g.txt then they  might end up using fred0.0.txt, fred1.0.txt, fred2.0.txt as the first file  in their rotating sequences.

A Connection object's database is able to provide information describing  its tables, its supported SQL grammar, its stored procedures, the  capabilities of this connection, and so on. This information is obtained  with the getMetaData method.  Note: When configuring a Connection, JDBC applications should use the  appropritate Connection method such as setAutoCommit or  setTransactionIsolation. Applications should not invoke SQL commands  directly to change the connection's configuration when there is a JDBC  method available. By default a Connection object is in auto-commit mode,  which means that it automatically commits changes after executing each  statement. If auto-commit mode has been disabled, the method commit must be  called explicitly in order to commit changes; otherwise, database changes  will not be saved.  A new Connection object created using the JDBC 2.1 core API has an  initially empty type map associated with it. A user may enter a custom  mapping for a UDT in this type map. When a UDT is retrieved from a data  source with the method ResultSet.getObject, the getObject method will check  the connection's type map to see if there is an entry for that UDT. If so,  the getObject method will map the UDT to the class indicated. If there is  no entry, the UDT will be mapped using the standard mapping.  A user may create a new type map, which is a java.util.Map object, make an  entry in it, and pass it to the java.sql methods that can perform custom  mapping. In this case, the method will use the given type map instead of  the one associated with the connection.  For example, the following code fragment specifies that the SQL type  ATHLETES will be mapped to the class Athletes in the Java programming  language. The code fragment retrieves the type map for the Connection  object con, inserts the entry into it, and then sets the type map with the  new entry as the connection's type map.   java.util.Map map = con.getTypeMap(); map.put(mySchemaName.ATHLETES, Class.forName(Athletes)); con.setTypeMap(map);   See Also:     DriverManager.getConnection(java.lang.String, java.util.Properties),      Statement, ResultSet, DatabaseMetaData",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,8,374,clean

Remarks: Windows Forms includes built-in accessibility support that allows your application to work with accessibility client applications. Examples of accessibility client applications include screen enlarger and reviewer utilities, voice input utilities, on-screen keyboards, alternative input devices, and keyboard enhancement utilities. The DataGridViewRow.DataGridViewRowAccessibleObject class inherits from the AccessibleObject class to provide information about a DataGridViewRow to accessibility client applications. Each class that represents a visual part of the DataGridView-such as DataGridViewColumnHeaderCell, DataGridViewRowHeaderCell, DataGridViewRow and DataGridViewCell-also contains a class that inherits from AccessibleObject to provide information about the containing class and perform actions on behalf of accessibility client applications. There are instances when you will want to provide additional information, such as the name or description of the DataGridView control, to accessibility client applications. There are two ways of providing this additional information. To provide limited accessibility information for existing controls, set the control's AccessibleName and AccessibleDescription property values, which will be reported to accessibility client applications. Note You should change the AccessibleDefaultActionDescription and AccessibleRole property values only in rare situations, such as if you make a DataGridView look like a list. Occasionally, you might require more accessibility information or different accessibility actions to be included with your custom DataGridView or DataGridViewCell. To customize accessibility, you can write your own class that derives from the DataGridView.DataGridViewAccessibleObject or DataGridViewCell.DataGridViewCellAccessibleObject classes and override the CreateAccessibilityInstance method. For example, if you are writing a custom row header cell that implements unique custom actions, such as special hit testing within your cell, you should create a class that inherits from the DataGridViewRowHeaderCell.DataGridViewRowHeaderCellAccessibleObject class and override the CreateAccessibilityInstance method. The DataGridView exposes its data structure by using AccessibleRole values to define the data table hierarchy.

Remarks: You can use client application services to retrieve role information from an existing roles service by configuring your application to use the ClientRoleProvider class. After configuration, you can determine whether an authenticated user is in a particular role by calling the IsInRole method of the IPrincipal returned by the static Thread.CurrentPrincipal property. For applications configured to use client application services, this property returns a ClientRolePrincipal. Because this class implements the IPrincipal interface, you do not need to reference it explicitly. The ClientRolePrincipal.IsInRole method internally calls the ClientRoleProvider.IsUserInRole method. The ClientRoleProvider class is a read-only role membership provider that retrieves role information for authenticated users from the roles service indicated by the ServiceUri property. The value of the ServiceUri property is typically retrieved from the application configuration file along with other configuration values. For more information, see How to: Configure Client Application Services. You can retrieve the current ClientRoleProvider instance through the static Roles.Provider property. The ClientRoleProvider class supports only the GetRolesForUser and IsUserInRole methods of the RoleProvider abstract class. When you call one of these methods for a particular user, the service provider first checks the local data cache for role information. If the cache does not contain any role information or the cache has expired, the service provider retrieves the role information from the roles service and adds it to the cache. You can specify the time-out period for the roles cache when you configure client application services. To force the GetRolesForUser method to retrieve role data from the service instead of the local cache, call the ResetCache method first. You cannot use the ClientRoleProvider class to create or delete roles, or to modify the role membership of users. To create or modify role information, you must change the configuration of the role service on the server. Example: The following example code demonstrates how to use this property to programmatically set the roles service location.

2595,33758,461233,464977,8,"public abstract class DefaultRowSorter<M,I>   ","An implementation of RowSorter that provides sorting and filtering around a  grid-based data model. Beyond creating and installing a RowSorter, you very  rarely need to interact with one directly. Refer to TableRowSorter for a  concrete implementation of RowSorter for JTable.  Sorting is done based on the current SortKeys, in order. If two objects are  equal (the Comparator for the column returns 0) the next SortKey is used.  If no SortKeys remain or the order is UNSORTED, then the order of the rows  in the model is used.  Sorting of each column is done by way of a Comparator that you can specify  using the setComparator method. If a Comparator has not been specified, the  Comparator returned by Collator.getInstance() is used on the results of  calling toString on the underlying objects. The Comparator is never passed  null. A null value is treated as occuring before a non-null value, and two  null values are considered equal.  If you specify a Comparator that casts its argument to a type other than  that provided by the model, a ClassCastException will be thrown when the  data is sorted.  In addition to sorting, DefaultRowSorter provides the ability to filter  rows. Filtering is done by way of a RowFilter that is specified using the  setRowFilter method. If no filter has been specified all rows are included.  By default, rows are in unsorted order (the same as the model) and every  column is sortable. The default Comparators are documented in the  subclasses (for example, TableRowSorter).  If the underlying model structure changes (the modelStructureChanged  method is invoked) the following are reset to their default values:  Comparators by column, current sort order, and whether each column is  sortable. To find the default Comparators, see the concrete implementation  (for example, TableRowSorter). The default sort order is unsorted (the same  as the model), and columns are sortable by default.  If the underlying model structure changes (the modelStructureChanged  method is invoked) the following are reset to their default values:  Comparators by column, current sort order and whether a column is sortable.  DefaultRowSorter is an abstract class. Concrete subclasses must provide  access to the underlying data by invoking setModelWrapper. The  setModelWrapper method must be invoked soon after the constructor is  called, ideally from within the subclass's constructor. Undefined behavior  will result if you use a DefaultRowSorter without specifying a  ModelWrapper.  DefaultRowSorter has two formal type parameters. The first type parameter  corresponds to the class of the model, for example DefaultTableModel. The  second type parameter corresponds to the class of the identifier passed to  the RowFilter. Refer to TableRowSorter and RowFilter for more details on  the type parameters.  Since:     1.6 See Also:     TableRowSorter, DefaultTableModel, Collator",1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,5,442,clean

Remarks: ASP.NET membership is designed to enable you to easily use a number of different membership providers for your ASP.NET applications. You can use the supplied membership providers that are included with the .NET Framework, or you can implement your own provider. Note If you are not familiar with the membership features of ASP.NET, see Introduction to Membership before continuing. For a list of other topics related to membership, see Managing Users by Using Membership. When implementing a custom membership provider, you are required to inherit the MembershipProvider abstract class. There are two primary reasons for creating a custom membership provider. You need to store membership information in a data source that is not supported by the membership providers included with the .NET Framework, such as a FoxPro database, an Oracle database, or other data source. You need to manage membership information using a database schema that is different from the database schema used by the providers that ship with the .NET Framework. A common example of this would be membership data that already exists in a SQL Server database for a company or Web site. The MembershipProvider abstract class inherits from the ProviderBase abstract class. MembershipProvider implementations must also implement the required members of ProviderBase.

Remarks: Concurrency control is a technique that data stores use to control how data is read and changed in the store when multiple clients are accessing and manipulating the same data. For example, one client reads data and presents it to a user, while another client reads the same data, and presents it to a different user. If both users update the data and submit it to the data storage, some unexpected result might occur, because the clients might update different values for the same data. This is considered a conflict. The ConflictDetection property that is defined for ASP.NET data source controls is used to determine how a control handles data conflicts in the underlying data storage when the underlying data storage is using optimistic concurrency and a delete or update operation is performed. By default, the ConflictDetection property is set to OverwriteChanges, which means the data source control will overwrite any changes made to a data row between the time the data source control first read data from the row and the time that the row is updated. The primary key is used for locating the data row that will be updated or deleted, but no other comparison of the data is performed. If the data source control is configured to use the CompareAllValues option, however, the control passes the original data in the oldValues collections of the Update and Delete methods so that you can write logic to update or delete data only if these values match the values currently in the data storage. The matching values indicate that the data has not changed since the time it was read.",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,296,clean

2628,32620,447584,451328,8,public interface ResultSet   ,"A table of data representing a database result set, which is usually  generated by executing a statement that queries the database.  A ResultSet object maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data.  Initially the cursor is positioned before the first row. The next method  moves the cursor to the next row, and because it returns false when there  are no more rows in the ResultSet object, it can be used in a while loop to  iterate through the result set.  A default ResultSet object is not updatable and has a cursor that moves  forward only. Thus, you can iterate through it only once and only from the  first row to the last row. It is possible to produce ResultSet objects that  are scrollable and/or updatable. The following code fragment, in which con  is a valid Connection object, illustrates how to make a result set that is  scrollable and insensitive to updates by others, and that is updatable. See  ResultSet fields for other options.    Statement stmt = con.createStatement( ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE); ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(SELECT a, b FROM TABLE2); // rs will be scrollable, will not show changes made by others, // and will be updatable    The ResultSet interface provides getter methods (getBoolean, getLong, and  so on) for retrieving column values from the current row. Values can be  retrieved using either the index number of the column or the name of the  column. In general, using the column index will be more efficient. Columns  are numbered from 1. For maximum portability, result set columns within  each row should be read in left-to-right order, and each column should be  read only once.  For the getter methods, a JDBC driver attempts to convert the underlying  data to the Java type specified in the getter method and returns a suitable  Java value. The JDBC specification has a table showing the allowable  mappings from SQL types to Java types that can be used by the ResultSet  getter methods.  Column names used as input to getter methods are case insensitive. When a  getter method is called with a column name and several columns have the  same name, the value of the first matching column will be returned. The  column name option is designed to be used when column names are used in the  SQL query that generated the result set. For columns that are NOT  explicitly named in the query, it is best to use column numbers. If column  names are used, the programmer should take care to guarantee that they  uniquely refer to the intended columns, which can be assured with the SQL  AS clause.  A set of updater methods were added to this interface in the JDBC 2.0 API  (JavaTM 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.2). The comments regarding  parameters to the getter methods also apply to parameters to the updater  methods.  The updater methods may be used in two ways:     1. to update a column value in the current row. In a scrollable        ResultSet object, the cursor can be moved backwards and forwards, to       an absolute position, or to a position relative to the current row.       The following code fragment updates the NAME column in the fifth row       of the ResultSet object rs and then uses the method updateRow to       update the data source table from which rs was derived.          rs.absolute(5); // moves the cursor to the fifth row of rs rs.updateString(NAME, AINSWORTH); // updates the // NAME column of row 5 to be AINSWORTH rs.updateRow(); // updates the row in the data source       2. to insert column values into the insert row. An updatable ResultSet        object has a special row associated with it that serves as a staging       area for building a row to be inserted. The following code fragment       moves the cursor to the insert row, builds a three-column row, and       inserts it into rs and into the data source table using the method        insertRow.          rs.moveToInsertRow(); // moves cursor to the insert row rs.updateString(1, AINSWORTH); // updates the // first column of the insert row to be AINSWORTH rs.updateInt(2,35); // updates the second column to be 35 rs.updateBoolean(3, true); // updates the third column to true rs.insertRow(); rs.moveToCurrentRow();    A ResultSet object is automatically closed when the Statement object that  generated it is closed, re-executed, or used to retrieve the next result  from a sequence of multiple results.  The number, types and properties of a ResultSet object's columns are  provided by the ResulSetMetaData object returned by the  ResultSet.getMetaData method.

The Message Queuing default is #.#, the local computer. Summary: Gets or sets the name of the computer where the Message Queuing queue is located. Remarks: The MachineName is an integral component of the friendly name syntax of the queue Path. The following table shows the syntax you should use for a queue of a specified type when you want to identify the queue path using its friendly name. Queue type Syntax Public queue MachineName\\QueueName Private queue MachineName\\Private$\\QueueName Journal queue MachineName\\QueueName\\Journal$ Machine journal queue MachineName\\Journal$ Machine dead-letter queue MachineName\\Deadletter$ Machine transactional dead-letter queue MachineName\\XactDeadletter$ Use #.# for the local computer when specifying the MachineName. Only the computer name is recognized for this property, for example, Server0. The MachineName property does not support the IP address format. If you define the Path in terms of the MachineName, the application throws an exception when working offline because the domain controller is required for path translation. Therefore, you must use the FormatName for the Path syntax when working offline. The MachineName, Path, and QueueName properties are related. Changing the MachineName property causes the Path property to change. It is built from the new MachineName and the QueueName. Changing the Path (for example, to use the format name syntax) resets the MachineName and QueueName properties to refer to the new queue. If the QueueName property is empty, the Path is set to the Journal queue of the computer you specify. The following table shows whether this property is available in various Workgroup modes.

Remarks: SamlSecurityToken security tokens specify their claims using SAML assertions and a set of conditions that must be taken into account when assessing the validity of the SAML assertion. The SamlDoNotCacheCondition class represents one of the conditions defined by the SAML specification and it asserts that the SAML assertion must not be cached.

The client is token agnostic for issued tokens type and processes it the returned issued token as an opaque XML element. However, security never caches the received issued token on the service side; it only caches the claims that are extracted from it during the token authentication process.

2677,32379,442798,446542,8,public final class ProcessBuilder   ,"This class is used to create operating system processes.  Each ProcessBuilder instance manages a collection of process attributes.  The start() method creates a new Process instance with those attributes.  The start() method can be invoked repeatedly from the same instance to  create new subprocesses with identical or related attributes.  Each process builder manages these process attributes:      * a command, a list of strings which signifies the external program       file to be invoked and its arguments, if any. Which string lists       represent a valid operating system command is system-dependent. For       example, it is common for each conceptual argument to be an element       in this list, but there are operating systems where programs are       expected to tokenize command line strings themselves - on such a       system a Java implementation might require commands to contain       exactly two elements.     * an environment, which is a system-dependent mapping from variables        to values. The initial value is a copy of the environment of the       current process (see System.getenv()).     * a working directory. The default value is the current working       directory of the current process, usually the directory named by the       system property user.dir.     * a redirectErrorStream property. Initially, this property is false,       meaning that the standard output and error output of a subprocess are       sent to two separate streams, which can be accessed using the        Process.getInputStream() and Process.getErrorStream() methods. If the       value is set to true, the standard error is merged with the standard       output. This makes it easier to correlate error messages with the       corresponding output. In this case, the merged data can be read from       the stream returned by Process.getInputStream(), while reading from       the stream returned by Process.getErrorStream() will get an immediate       end of file.  Modifying a process builder's attributes will affect processes subsequently  started by that object's start() method, but will never affect previously  started processes or the Java process itself.  Most error checking is performed by the start() method. It is possible to  modify the state of an object so that start() will fail. For example,  setting the command attribute to an empty list will not throw an exception  unless start() is invoked.  Note that this class is not synchronized. If multiple threads access a  ProcessBuilder instance concurrently, and at least one of the threads  modifies one of the attributes structurally, it must be synchronized  externally.  Starting a new process which uses the default working directory and  environment is easy:       Process p = new ProcessBuilder(myCommand, myArg).start();   Here is an example that starts a process with a modified working directory  and environment:       ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(myCommand, myArg1, myArg2); Map<String, String> env = pb.environment(); env.put(VAR1, myValue); env.remove(OTHERVAR); env.put(VAR2, env.get(VAR1) + suffix); pb.directory(new File(myDir)); Process p = pb.start();   To start a process with an explicit set of environment variables, first  call Map.clear() before adding environment variables.

This class describes an interface that a resource manager should implement to provide two phase commit notification callbacks for the transaction manager upon enlisting for participation. For each resource manager's implementation of the IEnlistmentNotification interface, you should enlist it using the EnlistVolatile method or the EnlistDurable method of the Transaction class, depending on whether your resource is volatile or durable. For more information on enlistment and 2PC, see Enlisting Resources As Participants In A Transaction and Committing A Transaction In Single-Phase and Multi-Phase respectively. The transaction manager notifies the enlisted object at different phases of the Two Phase Commit Protocol by the following methods.

TypeCode objects are used:      * in the Dynamic Invocation Interface -- to indicate the types of the       actual arguments or the type of the return value.       NamedValue objects are used to represent arguments and return values.       One of their components is an Any object, which in turn has as one of       its components a TypeCode object.     * by an Interface Repository to represent the type specifications that       are part of many OMG IDL declarations  The representation of a TypeCode object is opaque, but abstractly, a  TypeCode object consists of:      * a kind field, which is set to an instance of the class TCKind     * zero or more additional fields appropriate for the particular kind.       For example, the TypeCode object describing the OMG IDL type 1ong        has kind TCKind.tk_long and no additional fields. The TypeCode        describing OMG IDL type sequence<boolean, 10> has a kind field with       the value TCKind.tk_sequence and also fields with the values boolean        and 10 for the type of sequence elements and the length of the       sequence.  TypeCode objects can be obtained in various ways:    1. from a call to the method Any.insert_X, where X is a basic IDL type.       This method creates a TypeCode object for type X and assigns it to       the Any object's type field.    2. from invocations of methods in the ORB class        For example, the following creates a TypeCode object for a string        with a maximum of 30 characters:         org.omg.CORBA.TypeCode tcString = orb.create_string_tc(30);         The following creates a TypeCode object for an array of five string       s:         org.omg.CORBA.TypeCode tcArray = orb.create_array_tc( 5, TCKind.tk_string);         The following creates a TypeCode object for an interface named       Account:         org.omg.CORBA.TypeCode tcInterface = orb.create_interface_tc( thisId, Account);      3. as the return value from the _type method in Holder classes for       user-defined IDL types. These Holder classes are generated by the        idltojava compiler.    4. from a CORBA Interface Repository  Most of the methods in the class TypeCode are accessors, and the  information contained in a TypeCode object is specific to a particular  type. Therefore, methods must be invoked only on the kind of type codes to  which they apply. If an accessor method tries to access information from an  inappropriate kind of type code, it will throw the exception  TypeCodePackage.BadKind. For example, if the method discriminator_type is  called on anything other than a union, it will throw BadKind because only  unions have a discriminator. The following list shows which methods apply  to which kinds of type codes:  These methods may be invoked on all TypeCode kinds:      * equal     * kind  These methods may be invoked on objref, struct, union, enum, alias,  exception, value, value_box, native, and abstract_interface:      * id     * name  These methods may be invoked on struct, union, enum, and exception:      * member_count     * member_name  These methods may be invoked on struct, union, and exception:      * member_type(int index)  These methods may be invoked on union:      * member_label     * discriminator_type     * default_index  These methods may be invoked on string, sequence, and array:      * length  These methods may be invoked on alias, sequence, array, and value_box:      * content_type  Unlike other CORBA pseudo-objects, TypeCode objects can be passed as  general IDL parameters.

2753,34173,472078,475822,8,public class StyleSheet   ,"Support for defining the visual characteristics of HTML views being  rendered. The StyleSheet is used to translate the HTML model into visual  characteristics. This enables views to be customized by a look-and-feel,  multiple views over the same model can be rendered differently, etc. This  can be thought of as a CSS rule repository. The key for CSS attributes is  an object of type CSS.Attribute. The type of the value is up to the  StyleSheet implementation, but the toString method is required to return a  string representation of CSS value.  The primary entry point for HTML View implementations to get their  attributes is the getViewAttributes method. This should be implemented to  establish the desired policy used to associate attributes with the view.  Each HTMLEditorKit (i.e. and therefore each associated JEditorPane) can  have its own StyleSheet, but by default one sheet will be shared by all of  the HTMLEditorKit instances. HTMLDocument instance can also have a  StyleSheet, which holds the document-specific CSS specifications.  In order for Views to store less state and therefore be more lightweight,  the StyleSheet can act as a factory for painters that handle some of the  rendering tasks. This allows implementations to determine what they want to  cache and have the sharing potentially at the level that a selector is  common to multiple views. Since the StyleSheet may be used by views over  multiple documents and typically the HTML attributes don't effect the  selector being used, the potential for sharing is significant.  The rules are stored as named styles, and other information is stored to  translate the context of an element to a rule quickly. The following code  fragment will display the named styles, and therefore the CSS rules  contained.       import java.util.*;   import javax.swing.text.*;   import javax.swing.text.html.*;     public class ShowStyles {         public static void main(String[] args) {           HTMLEditorKit kit = new HTMLEditorKit();           HTMLDocument doc = (HTMLDocument) kit.createDefaultDocument();           StyleSheet styles = doc.getStyleSheet();             Enumeration rules = styles.getStyleNames();           while (rules.hasMoreElements()) {               String name = (String) rules.nextElement();               Style rule = styles.getStyle(name);               System.out.println(rule.toString());           }           System.exit(0);       }   }     The semantics for when a CSS style should overide visual attributes defined  by an element are not well defined. For example, the html <body  bgcolor=red> makes the body have a red background. But if the html file  also contains the CSS rule body { background: blue } it becomes less clear  as to what color the background of the body should be. The current  implemention gives visual attributes defined in the element the highest  precedence, that is they are always checked before any styles.

Summary: Represents the method that will handle the RowErrorTextNeeded event of a DataGridView. Remarks: The RowErrorTextNeeded event occurs only when the DataGridView control DataSource property is set or its VirtualMode property is true. Handling the RowErrorTextNeeded event is useful when you want to determine the error for a row depending on its state and the values it contains. When you handle the RowErrorTextNeeded event and specify error text in the handler, an error glyph appears in the row header unless the DataGridView.ShowRowErrors property is set to false. When the user moves the mouse pointer over the error glyph, the error text appears in a ToolTip. The RowErrorTextNeeded event also occurs whenever the value of the DataGridViewRow.ErrorText property is retrieved. You can use the DataGridViewRowErrorTextNeededEventArgs.RowIndex property to determine the state or value of a row, and use this information to change or modify the DataGridViewRowErrorTextNeededEventArgs.ErrorText property. This property is initialized with the value of the row ErrorText property, which the event value overrides. Handle the RowErrorTextNeeded event when working with large amounts of data to avoid the performance penalties of setting the row ErrorText value for multiple rows. For more information, see Best Practices for Scaling the Windows Forms DataGridView Control. For more information about handling events, see Consuming Events. When you create a DataGridViewRowErrorTextNeededEventHandler delegate, you identify the method that will handle the event.

This class cannot be inherited. Remarks: The AnonymousIdentificationSection class allows you to programmatically access and modify the anonymousIdentification element of a configuration file. The purpose of anonymous identification is to assign, at machine and application level, a unique identity to a non-authenticated user. This unique identity can then be used to track the user. Anonymous identification as used in this context does not have any relationship with the identity of the issuer of the Web request or with other security aspects related to the user; it simply assigns a unique identity for tracking purposes and user state management. Anonymous users are often tracked using the Session identifier. The main problems with this approach are the non-uniqueness of the identifier and the overhead involved in storing data to set a Session state value, which must be done in order to assign a session identifier to a user. Anonymous identification resolves these problems by providing a unique identifier for each non-authenticated user and not requiring the user to store any data to set the identifier.

2785,32697,449328,453072,8,public abstract class EnumSet<E extends Enum<E>>   ,"A specialized Set implementation for use with enum types. All of the  elements in an enum set must come from a single enum type that is  specified, explicitly or implicitly, when the set is created. Enum sets are  represented internally as bit vectors. This representation is extremely  compact and efficient. The space and time performance of this class should  be good enough to allow its use as a high-quality, typesafe alternative to  traditional int-based bit flags. Even bulk operations (such as  containsAll and retainAll) should run very quickly if their argument is  also an enum set.  The iterator returned by the iterator method traverses the elements in  their natural order (the order in which the enum constants are declared).  The returned iterator is weakly consistent: it will never throw  ConcurrentModificationException and it may or may not show the effects of  any modifications to the set that occur while the iteration is in progress.  Null elements are not permitted. Attempts to insert a null element will  throw NullPointerException. Attempts to test for the presence of a null  element or to remove one will, however, function properly.  Like most collection implementations, EnumSet is not synchronized. If  multiple threads access an enum set concurrently, and at least one of the  threads modifies the set, it should be synchronized externally. This is  typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally  encapsulates the enum set. If no such object exists, the set should be  wrapped using the Collections.synchronizedSet(java.util.Set ) method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized  access:   Set<MyEnum> s = Collections.synchronizedSet(EnumSet.noneOf(MyEnum.class));   Implementation note: All basic operations execute in constant time. They  are likely (though not guaranteed) to be much faster than their HashSet  counterparts. Even bulk operations execute in constant time if their  argument is also an enum set.

Parameters:         e1 - an element that this set is to contain initially         e2 - another element that this set is to contain initially         e3 - another element that this set is to contain initially         e4 - another element that this set is to contain initially         e5 - another element that this set is to contain initially     Returns:         an enum set initially containing the specified elements     Throws:         NullPointerException - if any parameters are null   of   public static <E extends Enum<E>> EnumSet<E> of(E first, E... rest)      Creates an enum set initially containing the specified elements. This     factory, whose parameter list uses the varargs feature, may be used to     create an enum set initially containing an arbitrary number of     elements, but it is likely to run slower than the overloadings that do     not use varargs.      Parameters:         first - an element that the set is to contain initially         rest - the remaining elements the set is to contain initially     Returns:         an enum set initially containing the specified elements     Throws:         NullPointerException - if any of the specified elements are null,         or if rest is null   range   public static <E extends Enum<E>> EnumSet<E> range(E from, E to)      Creates an enum set initially containing all of the elements in the     range defined by the two specified endpoints.

In June of 1996, the basic X.509 v3 format was completed by ISO/IEC and  ANSI X9, which is described below in ASN.1:   Certificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  { tbsCertificate       TBSCertificate, signatureAlgorithm   AlgorithmIdentifier, signature            BIT STRING  }   These certificates are widely used to support authentication and other  functionality in Internet security systems. Common applications include  Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM), Transport Layer Security (SSL), code signing  for trusted software distribution, and Secure Electronic Transactions  (SET).  These certificates are managed and vouched for by Certificate Authorities  (CAs). CAs are services which create certificates by placing data in the  X.509 standard format and then digitally signing that data. CAs act as  trusted third parties, making introductions between principals who have no  direct knowledge of each other. CA certificates are either signed by  themselves, or by some other CA such as a root CA.  More information can be found in RFC 2459, Internet X.509 Public Key  Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile at  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2459.txt .  The ASN.1 definition of tbsCertificate is:   TBSCertificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  { version         [0]  EXPLICIT Version DEFAULT v1, serialNumber         CertificateSerialNumber, signature            AlgorithmIdentifier, issuer               Name, validity             Validity, subject              Name, subjectPublicKeyInfo SubjectPublicKeyInfo, issuerUniqueID  [1]  IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL, -- If present, version must be v2 or v3 subjectUniqueID [2]  IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL, -- If present, version must be v2 or v3 extensions      [3]  EXPLICIT Extensions OPTIONAL -- If present, version must be v3 }   Certificates are instantiated using a certificate factory. The following is  an example of how to instantiate an X.509 certificate:   InputStream inStream = new FileInputStream(fileName-of-cert); CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance(X.509); X509Certificate cert = (X509Certificate)cf.generateCertificate(inStream); inStream.close();   See Also:     Certificate, CertificateFactory, X509Extension, Serialized Form",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,6,285,mixed

This class cannot be inherited. Remarks: A service description format extension extends how a service description is generated for an XML Web service created using ASP.NET. Specifically, a service description format extension adds XML elements to the service description. This is useful when a SOAP extension is built to run on both the client and server side of an XML Web service, as information about SOAP extensions is not automatically placed in the service description. If you add information about the SOAP extension to the service description, a client can thus interpret that it must run the specific SOAP extension. An example of a SOAP extension that must run on both the client and server is an encryption SOAP extension. If an encryption SOAP extension runs on only the server, and it encrypts return values before sending them back to the client, the client must have the SOAP extension running to decrypt the SOAP message. Otherwise, the client cannot process the return value. Use the following steps to build a service description format extension: Build a class that derives from ServiceDescriptionFormatExtension. Apply a XmlFormatExtensionAttribute to the class and specify the extension points at which the service description format extension should run. Optionally, apply a XmlFormatExtensionPointAttribute to the class and specify a member within the class to act as a new extension point. Optionally, apply a XmlFormatExtensionPrefixAttribute to the class and specify the XML namespace prefix to be associated with XML elements generated by the service description format extension. Configure the service description format extension to run within the serviceDescriptionFormatExtensionTypes section of the configuration file.

Remarks: When an XML Web service client uses the HTTP-POST protocol, by default parameters are encoded within the HTTP body using URL encoding rules and uses plain XML for the response. This protocol uses classes that derive from MimeFormatter to encode parameters and return values into standard MIME formats. The encoders to use are specified in the service description. If you are building an XML Web service client using ASP.NET, then a proxy class deriving indirectly or directly from WebClientProtocol needs to be created for the XML Web service you want to call. When the XML Web service client is calling using HTTP, derive the proxy class HttpSimpleClientProtocol, which in turn derives from WebClientProtocol. HttpGetClientProtocol and HttpPostClientProtocol derive from HttpSimpleClientProtocol, providing the support for calling an XML Web service method using HTTP-GET and HTTP-POST respectively. Clients calling an XML Web service using SOAP should derive from SoapHttpClientProtocol. For details on building a proxy class, see [<topic://cpconcreatingwebserviceproxy>]. Example: The following example is a proxy class generated by the Wsdl.exe utility for the Math XML Web service below. The proxy class derives from HttpPostClientProtocol, which derives from the abstract HttpSimpleClientProtocol class.

All elements in the list must be mutually comparable using the specified comparator (that is, c.compare(e1, e2) must not throw a ClassCastException for any elements e1 and e2 in the list).  This sort is guaranteed to be stable: equal elements will not be reordered as a result of the sort.  The sorting algorithm is a modified mergesort (in which the merge is omitted if the highest element in the low sublist is less than the lowest element in the high sublist). This algorithm offers guaranteed n log(n) performance. The specified list must be modifiable, but need not be resizable. This implementation dumps the specified list into an array, sorts the array, and iterates over the list resetting each element from the corresponding position in the array. This avoids the n 2 log(n) performance that would result from attempting to sort a linked list in place.  Parameters: list - the list to be sorted. c - the comparator to determine the order of the list. A null value indicates that the elements' natural ordering should be used.

Remarks: The client application services feature uses this class to represent an authenticated user. When you configure your application to use client application services and forms authentication, you can authenticate a user by calling the static Membership.ValidateUser method. After authentication, you can retrieve a reference to the current ClientFormsIdentity instance through the Identity property of the IPrincipal retrieved through the static Thread.CurrentPrincipal property. For more information, see Client Application Services. You will typically access a ClientFormsIdentity object as an IIdentity reference to avoid a direct dependency on this class. You can determine whether a user is authenticated by checking the IIdentity.IsAuthenticated property of the identity. However, the user may be authenticated for Windows, but not for client application services. To determine whether the user is authenticated for client application services, you should also confirm that the IIdentity.AuthenticationType property value is #ClientForms#. You must use an explicit ClientFormsIdentity reference to call the RevalidateUser method, which is not defined by the IIdentity interface. Example: The following example code demonstrates how to use this class to silently revalidate a user when the application leaves the offline state. In this example, a CheckedChanged event handler updates the offline status to match the check box value. If the user sets the application to the online state, the event handler attempts to revalidate the user by calling the RevalidateUser method. However, if the authentication server is unavailable, the event handler returns the application to the offline state. Note The RevalidateUser method is for convenience only. Because it does not have a return value, it cannot indicate whether revalidation has failed. Revalidation can fail, for example, if the user credentials have changed on the server. In this case, you might want to include code that explicitly validates users after a service call fails.

Remarks: Concurrency control is a technique that data stores use to control how data is read and changed in the store when multiple clients are accessing and manipulating the same data. For example, one client reads data and presents it to a user, while another client reads the same data, and presents it to a different user. If both users update the data and submit it to the data storage, some unexpected result might occur, because the clients might update different values for the same data. This is considered a conflict. The ConflictDetection property that is defined for ASP.NET data source controls is used to determine how a control handles data conflicts in the underlying data storage when the underlying data storage is using optimistic concurrency and a delete or update operation is performed. By default, the ConflictDetection property is set to OverwriteChanges, which means the data source control will overwrite any changes made to a data row between the time the data source control first read data from the row and the time that the row is updated. The primary key is used for locating the data row that will be updated or deleted, but no other comparison of the data is performed. If the data source control is configured to use the CompareAllValues option, however, the control passes the original data in the oldValues collections of the Update and Delete methods so that you can write logic to update or delete data only if these values match the values currently in the data storage.

Common devices  include synthesizers, sequencers, MIDI input ports, and MIDI output ports.  A MidiDevice can be a transmitter or a receiver of MIDI events, or both.  Therefore, it can provide Transmitter or Receiver instances (or both).  Typically, MIDI IN ports provide transmitters, MIDI OUT ports and  synthesizers provide receivers. A Sequencer typically provides transmitters  for playback and receivers for recording.  A MidiDevice can be opened and closed explicitly as well as implicitly.  Explicit opening is accomplished by calling open(), explicit closing is  done by calling close() on the MidiDevice instance. If an application opens  a MidiDevice explicitly, it has to close it explicitly to free system  resources and enable the application to exit cleanly. Implicit opening is  done by calling MidiSystem.getReceiver and MidiSystem.getTransmitter. The  MidiDevice used by MidiSystem.getReceiver and MidiSystem.getTransmitter is  implementation-dependant unless the properties javax.sound.midi.Receiver  and javax.sound.midi.Transmitter are used (see the description of  properties to select default providers in MidiSystem). A MidiDevice that  was opened implicitly, is closed implicitly by closing the Receiver or  Transmitter that resulted in opening it. If more than one implicitly  opening Receiver or Transmitter were obtained by the application, the  decive is closed after the last Receiver or Transmitter has been closed. On  the other hand, calling getReceiver or getTransmitter on the device  instance directly does not open the device implicitly. Closing these  Transmitters and Receivers does not close the device implicitly. To use a  device with Receivers or Transmitters obtained this way, the device has to  be opened and closed explicitly.  If implicit and explicit opening and closing are mixed on the same  MidiDevice instance, the following rules apply:      * After an explicit open (either before or after implicit opens), the       device will not be closed by implicit closing. The only way to close       an explicitly opened device is an explicit close.     * An explicit close always closes the device, even if it also has been       opened implicitly. A subsequent implicit close has no further effect. To detect if a MidiDevice represents a hardware MIDI port, the following  programming technique can be used:   MidiDevice device = ...; if ( ! (device instanceof Sequencer) && ! (device instanceof Synthesizer)) { // we're now sure that device represents a MIDI port // ... }   A MidiDevice includes a MidiDevice.Info object to provide manufacturer  information and so on.

2922,33337,456047,459791,8,public class JMXConnectorFactory   ,"Factory to create JMX API connector clients. There are no instances of this  class.  Connections are usually made using the connect method of this class. More  advanced applications can separate the creation of the connector client,  using newJMXConnector and the establishment of the connection itself, using  JMXConnector.connect(Map).  Each client is created by an instance of JMXConnectorProvider. This  instance is found as follows. Suppose the given JMXServiceURL looks like  service:jmx:protocol:remainder. Then the factory will attempt to find the  appropriate JMXConnectorProvider for protocol. Each occurrence of the  character + or - in protocol is replaced by . or _, respectively.  A provider package list is searched for as follows:     1. If the environment parameter to newJMXConnector contains the key        jmx.remote.protocol.provider.pkgs then the associated value is the       provider package list.    2. Otherwise, if the system property jmx.remote.protocol.provider.pkgs        exists, then its value is the provider package list.    3. Otherwise, there is no provider package list.  The provider package list is a string that is interpreted as a list of  non-empty Java package names separated by vertical bars (|). If the string  is empty, then so is the provider package list. If the provider package  list is not a String, or if it contains an element that is an empty string,  a JMXProviderException is thrown.  If the provider package list exists and is not empty, then for each element  pkg of the list, the factory will attempt to load the class      pkg.protocol.ClientProvider  If the environment parameter to newJMXConnector contains the key  jmx.remote.protocol.provider.class.loader then the associated value is the  class loader to use to load the provider. If the associated value is not an  instance of ClassLoader, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.  If the jmx.remote.protocol.provider.class.loader key is not present in the  environment parameter, the calling thread's context class loader is used.  If the attempt to load this class produces a ClassNotFoundException, the  search for a handler continues with the next element of the list.  Otherwise, a problem with the provider found is signalled by a  JMXProviderException whose cause indicates the underlying exception, as  follows:      * if the attempt to load the class produces an exception other than        ClassNotFoundException, that is the cause;     * if Class.newInstance() for the class produces an exception, that is       the cause.  If no provider is found by the above steps, including the default case  where there is no provider package list, then the implementation will use  its own provider for protocol, or it will throw a MalformedURLException if  there is none. An implementation may choose to find providers by other  means. For example, it may support the JAR conventions for service  providers, where the service interface is JMXConnectorProvider.  Every implementation must support the RMI connector protocols, specified  with the string rmi or iiop.  Once a provider is found, the result of the newJMXConnector method is the  result of calling newJMXConnector on the provider.  The Map parameter passed to the JMXConnectorProvider is a new read-only  Map that contains all the entries that were in the environment parameter to  JMXConnectorFactory.newJMXConnector, if there was one. Additionally, if the  jmx.remote.protocol.provider.class.loader key is not present in the  environment parameter, it is added to the new read-only Map.

Remarks: The ChannelBase class provides an abstract base class implementation of the IChannel interface. It also requires that each channel be associated with a channel manager. Note that the only constructor available for creating instances of ChannelBase requires a channelManager input parameter. State changes are managed by inheriting from the CommunicationObject implementation of the state machine. The ChannelBase gets its default communication timeouts for the open, close, send and receive operations from the ChannelManagerBase associated with it. The ChannelBase also manages the manager for you. In addition to exposing a reference to the manager, the base class also notifies the manager when channels are created and destroyed. But the reference to the manager is only good until the channel is destroyed. Even if you do use the base class, you must still provide behaviors for opening and closing the channel. The default implementations of these methods do not provide useful information. You must also make sure to override GetProperty(Of T) whenever you implement a channel. GetProperty(Of T) is an excellent way to communicate information along the channel stack without having to know what channels are below you, or what channels above you may perform queries.

Remarks: Scale breaks are intentional discontinuities on the Y-axis that are most often used to redistribute the data points in a series on a chart. This feature improves readability when there are large differences between the high and low values of the data in one series being plotted. Scale breaks are not drawn for differences between data in multiple series. By default, scale breaks are disabled. You can enable scale breaks on the Y-axis by setting the Enabled property to true. To change the amount of vertical space of the scale break, you can specify a Spacing value. This is calculated as a percentage of the Y-axis scale. You must have sufficient separation between ranges of data points in a single series to draw a scale break. By default, a scale break can be added only if there is a separation between the data ranges of at least 25% of the chart. If you enable a scale break but it does not appear, even though there is sufficient distance between the data ranges, you can set the CollapsibleSpaceThreshold property to a value less than 25. Charts support up to five scale breaks per chart; however, the chart can become unreadable if you display more than one scale break. If you have more than two data ranges, consider using a different method for displaying this data. Use the MaxNumberOfBreaks property to reduce the number of scale breaks that can be displayed on the chart. When a scale break is used, the Y-axis labels may become offset. To disable the label offset, set the IsStaggered property to false. Scale breaks are not supported under any of the following conditions: Pie, doughnut, funnel, pyramid, radial or any stacked chart types are used. Custom intervals for labels, tick marks or grid lines are enabled.  The minimum or maximum value for the axis is set. Custom labels are used. A logarithmic Y-axis is specified. Axis views on the Y-axis, which include scrolling and zooming, are used. 3-D charts are used.

Many SAX applications will not need to implement this interface, but it  will be especially useful for applications that build XML documents from  databases or other specialised input sources, or for applications that use  URI types other than URLs.

This class cannot be inherited. Remarks: Forms authentication enables user and password validation for Web applications that do not require Windows authentication. With forms authentication, user information is stored in an external data source, such as a Membership database, or in the configuration file for an application. Once a user is authenticated, forms authentication maintains an authentication ticket in a cookie or in the URL so that an authenticated user does not need to supply credentials with each request. Forms authentication is enabled by setting the mode attribute of the authentication configuration element to Forms. You can require that all requests to an application contain a valid user authentication ticket by using the authorization configuration element to deny the request of any unknown user, as shown in the following example.  In the previous example, any request for an ASP.NET page that is part of the application requires a valid user name that is supplied by forms authentication. If no user name exists, then the request is redirected to the configured LoginUrl. The FormsAuthentication class provides access to methods and properties that you can use in an application that authenticates users. The RedirectToLoginPage method redirects a browser to the configured LoginUrl for users to log into an application. The RedirectFromLoginPage method redirects an authenticated user back to the original protected URL that was requested or to the DefaultUrl. There are also methods that enable you to manage forms-authentication tickets, if needed.

2996,32776,451137,454881,8,public interface Lock ,"Lock implementations provide more extensive locking operations than can be  obtained using synchronized methods and statements. They allow more  flexible structuring, may have quite different properties, and may support  multiple associated Condition objects.  A lock is a tool for controlling access to a shared resource by multiple  threads. Commonly, a lock provides exclusive access to a shared resource:  only one thread at a time can acquire the lock and all access to the shared  resource requires that the lock be acquired first. However, some locks may  allow concurrent access to a shared resource, such as the read lock of a  ReadWriteLock.  The use of synchronized methods or statements provides access to the  implicit monitor lock associated with every object, but forces all lock  acquisition and release to occur in a block-structured way: when multiple  locks are acquired they must be released in the opposite order, and all  locks must be released in the same lexical scope in which they were  acquired.  While the scoping mechanism for synchronized methods and statements makes  it much easier to program with monitor locks, and helps avoid many common  programming errors involving locks, there are occasions where you need to  work with locks in a more flexible way. For example, some algorithms for  traversing concurrently accessed data structures require the use of  hand-over-hand or chain locking: you acquire the lock of node A, then  node B, then release A and acquire C, then release B and acquire D and so  on. Implementations of the Lock interface enable the use of such techniques  by allowing a lock to be acquired and released in different scopes, and  allowing multiple locks to be acquired and released in any order.  With this increased flexibility comes additional responsibility. The  absence of block-structured locking removes the automatic release of locks  that occurs with synchronized methods and statements. In most cases, the  following idiom should be used:       Lock l = ...; l.lock(); try { // access the resource protected by this lock } finally { l.unlock(); }   When locking and unlocking occur in different scopes, care must be taken to  ensure that all code that is executed while the lock is held is protected  by try-finally or try-catch to ensure that the lock is released when  necessary.  Lock implementations provide additional functionality over the use of  synchronized methods and statements by providing a non-blocking attempt to  acquire a lock (tryLock()), an attempt to acquire the lock that can be  interrupted (lockInterruptibly(), and an attempt to acquire the lock that  can timeout (tryLock(long, TimeUnit)).  A Lock class can also provide behavior and semantics that is quite  different from that of the implicit monitor lock, such as guaranteed  ordering, non-reentrant usage, or deadlock detection. If an implementation  provides such specialized semantics then the implementation must document  those semantics.  Note that Lock instances are just normal objects and can themselves be used  as the target in a synchronized statement. Acquiring the monitor lock of a  Lock instance has no specified relationship with invoking any of the  lock() methods of that instance. It is recommended that to avoid confusion  you never use Lock instances in this way, except within their own  implementation.  Except where noted, passing a null value for any parameter will result in a  NullPointerException being thrown.   Memory Synchronization  All Lock implementations must enforce the same memory synchronization  semantics as provided by the built-in monitor lock, as described in The  Java Language Specification, Third Edition (17.4 Memory Model):      * A successful lock operation has the same memory synchronization       effects as a successful Lock action.     * A successful unlock operation has the same memory synchronization       effects as a successful Unlock action. Unsuccessful locking and unlocking operations, and reentrant  locking/unlocking operations, do not require any memory synchronization  effects.   Implementation Considerations  The three forms of lock acquisition (interruptible, non-interruptible, and  timed) may differ in their performance characteristics, ordering  guarantees, or other implementation qualities. Further, the ability to  interrupt the ongoing acquisition of a lock may not be available in a given  Lock class. Consequently, an implementation is not required to define  exactly the same guarantees or semantics for all three forms of lock  acquisition, nor is it required to support interruption of an ongoing lock  acquisition. An implementation is required to clearly document the  semantics and guarantees provided by each of the locking methods. It must  also obey the interruption semantics as defined in this interface, to the  extent that interruption of lock acquisition is supported: which is either  totally, or only on method entry.  As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for interruption  are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding to an  interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be shown  that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked the  thread. An implementation should document this behavior.

Remarks: You can include a JavaScript file on an ASP.NET Web page by registering it through a ScriptReference object. You can register a script file that is located as a .js file (a static script file) on the Web site. You can also register a script file that is embedded as a resource in an assembly. After registering the script file, you can use its functions in client script on the Web page. To register a static script file, set the Path property of the ScriptReference object to the relative location of the file. To register a script file that is embedded as a resource in an assembly, set the Assembly property to the name of the assembly that contains the file. Then set the Name property to the name of the .js file that is embedded in the assembly. In that case, the script file must be embedded, not linked. You set the ScriptMode property to indicate whether to use the debug or release version of the script. The Auto value produces different results depending on whether it refers to a standalone script file or to a script file that is embedded as a resource in an assembly. A standalone script file is defined with the Path property. An assembly reference must be accessed through the Name and Assembly properties. The results for the Auto value are as follows: When it is applied to a standalone script file where the Path property is specified, the Auto value is equivalent to Release. When it is applied to a script reference in an assembly, Auto is equivalent to Inherit. When only Name is specified, it is used to reference the script. When Name and the Path property are both specified, the Path property is used instead of Name, but the Auto value is still equivalent to Inherit. Example: The following example shows how to reference a custom control and a JavaScript file that is embedded in the control assembly. The assembly is assumed to be in the Bin folder of the Web site. The custom control animates UpdatePanel controls. The JavaScript file is compiled as an embedded resource that is named SampleControl.UpdatePanelAnimation.js. You register the embedded JavaScript file by using the Assembly and Name properties. To use this example, compile the JavaScript file that is shown in the example as an embedded resource with the custom control. Put the resulting assembly into the Bin folder of the Web site. For an example of how to embed a JavaScript file in an assembly, see Walkthrough: Embedding a JavaScript File as a Resource in an Assembly. The following example shows a page that uses the custom control.  The following example shows the custom control class definition.    The following example shows the supporting JavaScript file.    The following example shows code that you must add to the AssemblyInfo file of the project that contains the custom control and the JavaScript file.

3043,34489,475445,479189,8,public interface GSSContext ,"This interface encapsulates the GSS-API security context and provides the  security services that are available over the context. Security contexts  are established between peers using locally acquired credentials. Multiple  contexts may exist simultaneously between a pair of peers, using the same  or different set of credentials. GSS-API functions in a manner independent  of the underlying transport protocol and depends on its calling application  to transport the tokens that are generated by the security context between  the peers.  If the caller instantiates the context using the default GSSManager  instance, then the Kerberos v5 GSS-API mechanism is guaranteed to be  available for context establishment. This mechanism is identified by the  Oid 1.2.840.113554.1.2.2 and is defined in RFC 1964.  Before the context establishment phase is initiated, the context initiator  may request specific characteristics desired of the established context.  Not all underlying mechanisms support all characteristics that a caller  might desire. After the context is established, the caller can check the  actual characteristics and services offered by that context by means of  various query methods. When using the Kerberos v5 GSS-API mechanism offered  by the default GSSManager instance, all optional services will be available  locally. They are mutual authentication, credential delegation,  confidentiality and integrity protection, and per-message replay detection  and sequencing. Note that in the GSS-API, message integrity is a  prerequisite for message confidentiality.  The context establishment occurs in a loop where the initiator calls  initSecContext and the acceptor calls acceptSecContext until the context is  established. While in this loop the initSecContext and acceptSecContext  methods produce tokens that the application sends over to the peer. The  peer passes any such token as input to its acceptSecContext or  initSecContext as the case may be.  During the context establishment phase, the isProtReady method may be  called to determine if the context can be used for the per-message  operations of wrap and getMIC. This allows applications to use per-message  operations on contexts which aren't yet fully established.  After the context has been established or the isProtReady method returns  true, the query routines can be invoked to determine the actual  characteristics and services of the established context. The application  can also start using the per-message methods of wrap and getMIC to obtain  cryptographic operations on application supplied data.  When the context is no longer needed, the application should call dispose  to release any system resources the context may be using.  A security context typically maintains sequencing and replay detection  information about the tokens it processes. Therefore, the sequence in which  any tokens are presented to this context for processing can be important.  Also note that none of the methods in this interface are synchronized.  Therefore, it is not advisable to share a GSSContext among several threads  unless some application level synchronization is in place.  Finally, different mechanism providers might place different security  restrictions on using GSS-API contexts. These will be documented by the  mechanism provider. The application will need to ensure that it has the  appropriate permissions if such checks are made in the mechanism layer.  The example code presented below demonstrates the usage of the GSSContext  interface for the initiating peer. Different operations on the GSSContext  object are presented, including: object instantiation, setting of desired  flags, context establishment, query of actual context flags, per-message  operations on application data, and finally context deletion.   // Create a context using default credentials // and the implementation specific default mechanism GSSManager manager ...

This class cannot be inherited. Remarks: You use the ConfigurationCollectionAttribute attribute to decorate a ConfigurationElementCollection element. This instructs the .NET Framework to create an instance of the collection and to initialize it using your custom ConfigurationElement values. Note The simplest way to create a custom configuration element is to use the attributed (declarative) model. You declare the elements and decorate them with the ConfigurationCollectionAttribute attribute. For each element marked with this attribute, the .NET Framework uses reflection to read the decorating parameters and create a related ConfigurationElementCollection instance. You can also use the programmatic model. In this case it is your responsibility to declare the custom public collection but also to override the ConfigurationElementCollection member and return the properties collection. The .NET Framework configuration system provides attribute types that you can use during the creation of custom configuration elements. There are two kinds of attributes: The attributes that instruct the .NET Framework how to create instances of the custom configuration element properties. These types include: ConfigurationCollectionAttribute ConfigurationPropertyAttribute The attributes that instruct the .NET Framework how to validate the custom configuration element properties. These types include: IntegerValidatorAttribute LongValidatorAttribute RegexStringValidatorAttribute StringValidatorAttribute TimeSpanValidatorAttribute Example: The following example shows how to use the ConfigurationCollectionAttribute. This example consists of three classes: UrlsSection, UrlsCollection and UrlConfigElement.The UrlsSection class uses the ConfigurationCollectionAttribute to define a custom configuration section.

An example of  an RDN is OU=Sales+CN=J.Smith. In this example, the RDN consist of  multiple attribute type/value pairs. The RDN is parsed as described in the  class description for LdapName.  The Rdn class represents an RDN as attribute type/value mappings, which can  be viewed using Attributes. In addition, it contains convenience methods  that allow easy retrieval of type and value when the Rdn consist of a  single type/value pair, which is how it appears in a typical usage. It also  contains helper methods that allow escaping of the unformatted attribute  value and unescaping of the value formatted according to the escaping  syntax defined in RFC2253. For methods that take or return attribute value  as an Object, the value is either a String (in unescaped form) or a byte  array.  Rdn will properly parse all valid RDNs, but does not attempt to detect all  possible violations when parsing invalid RDNs. It is generous in  accepting invalid RDNs. The validity of a name is determined ultimately  when it is supplied to an LDAP server, which may accept or reject the name  based on factors such as its schema information and interoperability  considerations.  The following code example shows how to construct an Rdn using the  constructor that takes type and value as arguments:   Rdn rdn = new Rdn(cn, Juicy, Fruit); System.out.println(rdn.toString());   The last line will print cn=Juicy , Fruit. The unescapeValue() method can  be used to unescape the escaped comma resulting in the original value  Juicy, Fruit. The escapeValue() method adds the escape back preceding the  comma.  This class can be instantiated by a string representation of the RDN  defined in RFC 2253 as shown in the following code example:   Rdn rdn = new Rdn(cn=Juicy  , Fruit); System.out.println(rdn.toString());   The last line will print cn=Juicy , Fruit.

3092,32620,447584,451328,8,public interface ResultSet   ,"A table of data representing a database result set, which is usually  generated by executing a statement that queries the database.  A ResultSet object maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data.  Initially the cursor is positioned before the first row. The next method  moves the cursor to the next row, and because it returns false when there  are no more rows in the ResultSet object, it can be used in a while loop to  iterate through the result set.  A default ResultSet object is not updatable and has a cursor that moves  forward only. Thus, you can iterate through it only once and only from the  first row to the last row. It is possible to produce ResultSet objects that  are scrollable and/or updatable. The following code fragment, in which con  is a valid Connection object, illustrates how to make a result set that is  scrollable and insensitive to updates by others, and that is updatable. See  ResultSet fields for other options.    Statement stmt = con.createStatement( ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE); ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(SELECT a, b FROM TABLE2); // rs will be scrollable, will not show changes made by others, // and will be updatable    The ResultSet interface provides getter methods (getBoolean, getLong, and  so on) for retrieving column values from the current row. Values can be  retrieved using either the index number of the column or the name of the  column. In general, using the column index will be more efficient. Columns  are numbered from 1. For maximum portability, result set columns within  each row should be read in left-to-right order, and each column should be  read only once.  For the getter methods, a JDBC driver attempts to convert the underlying  data to the Java type specified in the getter method and returns a suitable  Java value. The JDBC specification has a table showing the allowable  mappings from SQL types to Java types that can be used by the ResultSet  getter methods.  Column names used as input to getter methods are case insensitive. When a  getter method is called with a column name and several columns have the  same name, the value of the first matching column will be returned. The  column name option is designed to be used when column names are used in the  SQL query that generated the result set. For columns that are NOT  explicitly named in the query, it is best to use column numbers. If column  names are used, the programmer should take care to guarantee that they  uniquely refer to the intended columns, which can be assured with the SQL  AS clause.  A set of updater methods were added to this interface in the JDBC 2.0 API  (JavaTM 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.2). The comments regarding  parameters to the getter methods also apply to parameters to the updater  methods.  The updater methods may be used in two ways:     1. to update a column value in the current row. In a scrollable        ResultSet object, the cursor can be moved backwards and forwards, to       an absolute position, or to a position relative to the current row.       The following code fragment updates the NAME column in the fifth row       of the ResultSet object rs and then uses the method updateRow to       update the data source table from which rs was derived.          rs.absolute(5); // moves the cursor to the fifth row of rs rs.updateString(NAME, AINSWORTH); // updates the // NAME column of row 5 to be AINSWORTH rs.updateRow(); // updates the row in the data source       2. to insert column values into the insert row. An updatable ResultSet        object has a special row associated with it that serves as a staging       area for building a row to be inserted. The following code fragment       moves the cursor to the insert row, builds a three-column row, and       inserts it into rs and into the data source table using the method        insertRow.          rs.moveToInsertRow(); // moves cursor to the insert row rs.updateString(1, AINSWORTH); // updates the // first column of the insert row to be AINSWORTH rs.updateInt(2,35); // updates the second column to be 35 rs.updateBoolean(3, true); // updates the third column to true rs.insertRow(); rs.moveToCurrentRow();    A ResultSet object is automatically closed when the Statement object that  generated it is closed, re-executed, or used to retrieve the next result  from a sequence of multiple results.  The number, types and properties of a ResultSet object's columns are  provided by the ResulSetMetaData object returned by the  ResultSet.getMetaData method.

Remarks: The LinqDataSourceValidationException class contains type conversion and property setter exceptions. All of the exceptions that are thrown during validation are contained in the InnerExceptions collection. You can retrieve each validation exception by iterating through the InnerExceptions collection. You typically handle exceptions in the Updating, Deleting, and Inserting events. If a validation exception is thrown, the Exception property of the LinqDataSourceUpdateEventArgs, LinqDataSourceDeleteEventArgs, or LinqDataSourceInsertEventArgs object contains a LinqDataSourceValidationException object. If no exception is thrown, the Exception property contains Nothing. To handle validation exceptions, create a handler for the Updating, Deleting, or Inserting event. In the event handler, check whether the Exception property of the event argument class contains a value other than Nothing. If the Exception property is not null, one or more validation exceptions were thrown and you can retrieve each validation exception in the InnerExceptions property. A validation exception can occur if a value does not match the type of the property. For example, trying to update an integer property by using non-numeric characters causes a validation exception. A LINQ to SQL class can also contain customized validation criteria that make sure that the property contains a value that is within an expected range or pattern.

Remarks: The DataGridViewImageColumn class is a specialized type of the DataGridViewColumn class used to logically host cells that display images. A DataGridViewImageColumn has an associated DataGridViewImageCell in every DataGridViewRow that intersects it. Each cell is capable of containing an Image or an Icon, depending on the value of the DataGridViewImageCell.ValueIsIcon property. Displaying icons is useful to accommodate images with transparency. By default, empty cells display a default error graphic. To prevent this graphic from appearing for cell values equal to Nothing or DBNull.Value, set the DataGridViewCellStyle.NullValue property of the cell style object returned by the DefaultCellStyle property to Nothing before adding rows to the control. This does not affect the row for new records, however. To prevent the error graphic from appearing in the row for new records when the control AllowUserToAddRows property value is true, you must also either explicitly set the cell value to Nothing in a handler for the control RowsAdded event or set the column CellTemplate property to an instance of a DataGridViewImageCell-derived type with an overridden DefaultNewRowValue property that returns Nothing. The default sort mode for this column type is NotSortable. Notes to Inheritors When you derive from DataGridViewImageColumn and add new properties to the derived class, be sure to override the Clone method to copy the new properties during cloning operations. You should also call the base class's Clone method so that the properties of the base class are copied to the new cell.

A TrayIcon can have a tooltip (text), an image, a popup menu, and a  set of listeners associated with it.  A TrayIcon can generate various MouseEvents and supports adding  corresponding listeners to receive notification of these events. TrayIcon  processes some of the events by itself. For example, by default, when the  right-mouse click is performed on the TrayIcon it displays the specified  popup menu. When the mouse hovers over the TrayIcon the tooltip is  displayed.  Note: When the MouseEvent is dispatched to its registered listeners its  component property will be set to null. (See ComponentEvent.getComponent() ) The source property will be set to this TrayIcon. (See  EventObject.getSource())  Note: A well-behaved TrayIcon implementation will assign different gestures  to showing a popup menu and selecting a tray icon.  A TrayIcon can generate an ActionEvent. On some platforms, this occurs when  the user selects the tray icon using either the mouse or keyboard.  If a SecurityManager is installed, the AWTPermission accessSystemTray must  be granted in order to create a TrayIcon. Otherwise the constructor will  throw a SecurityException.

Items are listed in order of decreasing search  precedence:      * If the JavaServer Faces configuration file bundled into the WEB-INF        directory of the webapp contains a factory entry of the given factory       class name, that factory is used.      * If the JavaServer Faces configuration files named by the        javax.faces.CONFIG_FILES ServletContext init parameter contain any        factory entries of the given factory class name, those factories are       used, with the last one taking precedence.      * If there are any JavaServer Faces configuration files bundled into       the META-INF directory of any jars on the ServletContext's resource       paths, the factory entries of the given factory class name in those       files are used, with the last one taking precedence.      * If a META-INF/services/{factory-class-name} resource is visible to       the web application class loader for the calling application       (typically as a result of being present in the manifest of a JAR       file), its first line is read and assumed to be the name of the       factory implementation class to use.      * If none of the above steps yield a match, the JavaServer Faces       implementation specific class is used.  If any of the factories found on any of the steps above happen to have a  one-argument constructor, with argument the type being the abstract factory  class, that constructor is invoked, and the previous match is passed to the  constructor. For example, say the container vendor provided an  implementation of FacesContextFactory, and identified it in  META-INF/services/javax.faces.context.FacesContextFactory in a jar on the  webapp ClassLoader. Also say this implementation provided by the container  vendor had a one argument constructor that took a FacesContextFactory  instance. The FactoryFinder system would call that one-argument  constructor, passing the implementation of FacesContextFactory provided by  the JavaServer Faces implementation.  If a Factory implementation does not provide a proper one-argument  constructor, it must provide a zero-arguments constructor in order to be  successfully instantiated.  Once the name of the factory implementation class is located, the web  application class loader for the calling application is requested to load  this class, and a corresponding instance of the class will be created. A  side effect of this rule is that each web application will receive its own  instance of each factory class, whether the JavaServer Faces implementation  is included within the web application or is made visible through the  container's facilities for shared libraries.",1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,6,433,clean

Remarks: The ExpandoObject class enables you to add and delete members of its instances at run time and also to set and get values of these members. This class supports dynamic binding, which enables you to use standard syntax like sampleObject.sampleMember instead of more complex syntax like sampleObject.GetAttribute(#sampleMember#). The ExpandoObject class implements the standard Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) interface IDynamicMetaObjectProvider, which enables you to share instances of the ExpandoObject class between languages that support the DLR interoperability model. For example, you can create an instance of the ExpandoObject class in  and then pass it to an IronPython function. For more information, see Dynamic Language Runtime Overview documentation on the CodePlex Web site, and Introducing the ExpandoObject on the  Frequently Asked Questions Web site. The ExpandoObject class is an implementation of the dynamic object concept that enables getting, setting, and invoking members. If you want to define types that have their own dynamic dispatch semantics, use the DynamicObject class. If you want to define how dynamic objects participate in the interoperability protocol and manage DLR fast dynamic dispatch caching, create your own implementation of the IDynamicMetaObjectProvider interface. Creating an Instance In , to enable late binding for an instance of the ExpandoObject class, you must use the dynamic keyword. For more information, see Using Type dynamic ( Programming Guide). In Visual Basic, dynamic operations are supported by late binding. For more information, see Early and Late Binding (Visual Basic). The following code example demonstrates how to create an instance of the ExpandoObject class.  Adding New Members You can add properties, methods, and events to instances of the ExpandoObject class. The following code example demonstrates how to add a new property to an instance of the ExpandoObject class.    The methods represent lambda expressions that are stored as delegates, which can be invoked when they are needed. The following code example demonstrates how to add a method that increments a value of the dynamic property.    The following code example demonstrates how to add an event to an instance of the ExpandoObject class.   class Program { static void Main(string[] args) {  // Create a new event and initialize it with null. sampleObject.sampleEvent = null; // Add an event handler. sampleObject.sampleEvent += new EventHandler(SampleHandler); // Raise an event for testing purposes. sampleObject.sampleEvent(sampleObject, new EventArgs()); } // Event handler. static void SampleHandler(object sender, EventArgs e) { Console.WriteLine(#SampleHandler for {0} event#, sender); } } // This code example produces the following output: // SampleHandler for System.Dynamic.ExpandoObject event. Passing As a Parameter You can pass instances of the ExpandoObject class as parameters. Note that these instances are treated as dynamic objects in  and late-bound objects in Visual Basic. This means that you do not have IntelliSense for object members and you do not receive compiler errors when you call non-existent members. If you call a member that does not exist, an exception occurs. The following code example demonstrates how you can create and use a method to print the names and values of properties.    Enumerating and Deleting Members The ExpandoObject class implements the IDictionary<String, Object> interface. This enables enumeration of members added to the instance of the ExpandoObject class at run time. This can be useful if you do not know at compile time what members an instance might have. The following code example shows how you can cast an instance of the ExpandoObject class to the IDictionary(Of TKey, TValue) interface and enumerate the instance's members.    In languages that do not have syntax for deleting members (such as  and Visual Basic), you can delete a member by implicitly casting an instance of the ExpandoObject to the IDictionary<String, Object> interface and then deleting the member as a key/value pair. This is shown in the following example.    Receiving Notifications of Property Changes The ExpandoObject class implements the INotifyPropertyChanged interface and can raise a PropertyChanged event when a member is added, deleted, or modified. This enables ExpandoObject class integration with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) data binding and other environments that require notification about changes in the object content. The following code example demonstrates how to create an event handler for the PropertyChanged event. ThreadSafety: Any public static (Shared in Visual Basic) members of this type are thread safe.

3178,32697,449328,453072,8,public abstract class EnumSet<E extends Enum<E>>   ,"A specialized Set implementation for use with enum types. All of the  elements in an enum set must come from a single enum type that is  specified, explicitly or implicitly, when the set is created. Enum sets are  represented internally as bit vectors. This representation is extremely  compact and efficient. The space and time performance of this class should  be good enough to allow its use as a high-quality, typesafe alternative to  traditional int-based bit flags. Even bulk operations (such as  containsAll and retainAll) should run very quickly if their argument is  also an enum set.  The iterator returned by the iterator method traverses the elements in  their natural order (the order in which the enum constants are declared).  The returned iterator is weakly consistent: it will never throw  ConcurrentModificationException and it may or may not show the effects of  any modifications to the set that occur while the iteration is in progress.  Null elements are not permitted. Attempts to insert a null element will  throw NullPointerException. Attempts to test for the presence of a null  element or to remove one will, however, function properly.  Like most collection implementations, EnumSet is not synchronized. If  multiple threads access an enum set concurrently, and at least one of the  threads modifies the set, it should be synchronized externally. This is  typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally  encapsulates the enum set. If no such object exists, the set should be  wrapped using the Collections.synchronizedSet(java.util.Set ) method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized  access:   Set<MyEnum> s = Collections.synchronizedSet(EnumSet.noneOf(MyEnum.class));   Implementation note: All basic operations execute in constant time. They  are likely (though not guaranteed) to be much faster than their HashSet  counterparts. Even bulk operations execute in constant time if their  argument is also an enum set.

Classes that do not implement this  interface will not have any of their state serialized or deserialized. All  subtypes of a serializable class are themselves serializable. The  serialization interface has no methods or fields and serves only to  identify the semantics of being serializable.  To allow subtypes of non-serializable classes to be serialized, the subtype  may assume responsibility for saving and restoring the state of the  supertype's public, protected, and (if accessible) package fields. The  subtype may assume this responsibility only if the class it extends has an  accessible no-arg constructor to initialize the class's state. It is an  error to declare a class Serializable if this is not the case. The error  will be detected at runtime.  During deserialization, the fields of non-serializable classes will be  initialized using the public or protected no-arg constructor of the class.  A no-arg constructor must be accessible to the subclass that is  serializable. The fields of serializable subclasses will be restored from  the stream.  When traversing a graph, an object may be encountered that does not support  the Serializable interface. In this case the NotSerializableException will  be thrown and will identify the class of the non-serializable object.  Classes that require special handling during the serialization and  deserialization process must implement special methods with these exact  signatures:   private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException; private void readObjectNoData() throws ObjectStreamException;   The writeObject method is responsible for writing the state of the object  for its particular class so that the corresponding readObject method can  restore it. The default mechanism for saving the Object's fields can be  invoked by calling out.defaultWriteObject. The method does not need to  concern itself with the state belonging to its superclasses or subclasses.  State is saved by writing the individual fields to the ObjectOutputStream  using the writeObject method or by using the methods for primitive data  types supported by DataOutput.  The readObject method is responsible for reading from the stream and  restoring the classes fields. It may call in.defaultReadObject to invoke  the default mechanism for restoring the object's non-static and  non-transient fields. The defaultReadObject method uses information in the  stream to assign the fields of the object saved in the stream with the  correspondingly named fields in the current object. This handles the case  when the class has evolved to add new fields. The method does not need to  concern itself with the state belonging to its superclasses or subclasses.  State is saved by writing the individual fields to the ObjectOutputStream  using the writeObject method or by using the methods for primitive data  types supported by DataOutput.  The readObjectNoData method is responsible for initializing the state of  the object for its particular class in the event that the serialization  stream does not list the given class as a superclass of the object being  deserialized. This may occur in cases where the receiving party uses a  different version of the deserialized instance's class than the sending  party, and the receiver's version extends classes that are not extended by  the sender's version. This may also occur if the serialization stream has  been tampered; hence, readObjectNoData is useful for initializing  deserialized objects properly despite a hostile or incomplete source  stream.  Serializable classes that need to designate an alternative object to be  used when writing an object to the stream should implement this special  method with the exact signature:   ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER Object writeReplace() throws ObjectStreamException;   This writeReplace method is invoked by serialization if the method exists  and it would be accessible from a method defined within the class of the  object being serialized. Thus, the method can have private, protected and  package-private access. Subclass access to this method follows java  accessibility rules.  Classes that need to designate a replacement when an instance of it is read  from the stream should implement this special method with the exact  signature.   ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER Object readResolve() throws ObjectStreamException;   This readResolve method follows the same invocation rules and accessibility  rules as writeReplace.  The serialization runtime associates with each serializable class a version  number, called a serialVersionUID, which is used during deserialization to  verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded  classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization.  If the receiver has loaded a class for the object that has a different  serialVersionUID than that of the corresponding sender's class, then  deserialization will result in an InvalidClassException. A serializable  class can declare its own serialVersionUID explicitly by declaring a field  named serialVersionUID that must be static, final, and of type long:   ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER static final long serialVersionUID = 42L;   If a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialVersionUID,  then the serialization runtime will calculate a default serialVersionUID  value for that class based on various aspects of the class, as described in  the Java(TM) Object Serialization Specification. However, it is strongly  recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare  serialVersionUID values, since the default serialVersionUID computation is  highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler  implementations, and can thus result in unexpected InvalidClassExceptions  during deserialization. Therefore, to guarantee a consistent  serialVersionUID value across different java compiler implementations, a  serializable class must declare an explicit serialVersionUID value. It is  also strongly advised that explicit serialVersionUID declarations use the  private modifier where possible, since such declarations apply only to the  immediately declaring class--serialVersionUID fields are not useful as  inherited members. Array classes cannot declare an explicit  serialVersionUID, so they always have the default computed value, but the  requirement for matching serialVersionUID values is waived for array  classes.

Remarks: Web service writers and readers serialize and deserialize, respectively, between the parameter or return objects of Web methods and the HTTP request or response streams. The MimeFormatter class establishes a common interface and functionality for reader and writer classes, in both client and service-side . The MimeFormatter class supports the .NET Framework's implementations of Web services via the HTTP-GET and HTTP-POST operations. In HTTP-GET operations request parameters are encoded in the HTTP request's Uniform Resource Locator (URL). In HTTP-POST operations, request parameters are encoded in the HTTP request body, as with an HTML form. With both implementations, the return value appears in the HTTP response body as a non-SOAP XML document. A developer typically does not need to directly use MimeFormatter or its descendant classes. Instead, when the Wsdl.exe tool generates client proxy code according to the HTTP-GET or HTTP-POST implementations, it applies the HttpMethodAttribute to each Web method and sets the attribute's ParameterFormatter and ReturnFormatter properties to the appropriate type derived from the MimeFormatter class. On the server, the appropriate derived types are used according to settings in an ASP.NET configuration file (Web.config). On the client the appropriate derived types are determined from the WSDL.

3200,32064,434648,438392,8,public interface Composite ,"The Composite interface, along with CompositeContext, defines the methods  to compose a draw primitive with the underlying graphics area. After the  Composite is set in the Graphics2D context, it combines a shape, text, or  an image being rendered with the colors that have already been rendered  according to pre-defined rules. The classes implementing this interface  provide the rules and a method to create the context for a particular  operation. CompositeContext is an environment used by the compositing  operation, which is created by the Graphics2D prior to the start of the  operation. CompositeContext contains private information and resources  needed for a compositing operation. When the CompositeContext is no longer  needed, the Graphics2D object disposes of it in order to reclaim resources  allocated for the operation.  Instances of classes implementing Composite must be immutable because the  Graphics2D does not clone these objects when they are set as an attribute  with the setComposite method or when the Graphics2D object is cloned. This  is to avoid undefined rendering behavior of Graphics2D, resulting from the  modification of the Composite object after it has been set in the  Graphics2D context.  Since this interface must expose the contents of pixels on the target  device or image to potentially arbitrary code, the use of custom objects  which implement this interface when rendering directly to a screen device  is governed by the readDisplayPixels AWTPermission. The permission check  will occur when such a custom object is passed to the setComposite method  of a Graphics2D retrieved from a Component.

A counter monitor sends a threshold notification when the value of the  counter reaches or exceeds a threshold known as the comparison level. The  notify flag must be set to true.  In addition, an offset mechanism enables particular counting intervals to  be detected. If the offset value is not zero, whenever the threshold is  triggered by the counter value reaching a comparison level, that comparison  level is incremented by the offset value. This is regarded as taking place  instantaneously, that is, before the count is incremented. Thus, for each  level, the threshold triggers an event notification every time the count  increases by an interval equal to the offset value.  If the counter can wrap around its maximum value, the modulus needs to be  specified. The modulus is the value at which the counter is reset to zero.  If the counter difference mode is used, the value of the derived gauge is  calculated as the difference between the observed counter values for two  successive observations. If this difference is negative, the value of the  derived gauge is incremented by the value of the modulus.

Any models subclassed from this class and used in conjunction with a text  component that has a look and feel implementation that is derived from  BasicTextUI may be safely updated asynchronously, because all access to the  View hierarchy is serialized by BasicTextUI if the document is of type  AbstractDocument. The locking assumes that an independent thread will  access the View hierarchy only from the DocumentListener methods, and that  there will be only one event thread active at a time.  If concurrency support is desired, there are the following additional  implications. The code path for any DocumentListener implementation and any  UndoListener implementation must be threadsafe, and not access the  component lock if trying to be safe from deadlocks. The repaint and  revalidate methods on JComponent are safe.  AbstractDocument models an implied break at the end of the document. Among  other things this allows you to position the caret after the last  character. As a result of this, getLength returns one less than the length  of the Content. If you create your own Content, be sure and initialize it  to have an additional character. Refer to StringContent and GapContent for  examples of this. Another implication of this is that Elements that model  the implied end character will have an endOffset == (getLength() + 1). For  example, in DefaultStyledDocument  getParagraphElement(getLength()).getEndOffset() == getLength() + 1 .  Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for  short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of  Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been  added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,7,437,clean

An instance of the engine can be obtained using Pack200.newPacker().  The high degree of compression is achieved by using a number of techniques  described in the JSR 200 specification. Some of the techniques are sorting,  re-ordering and co-location of the constant pool.  The pack engine is initialized to an initial state as described by their  properties below. The initial state can be manipulated by getting the  engine properties (using properties()) and storing the modified properties  on the map. The resource files will be passed through with no changes at  all. The class files will not contain identical bytes, since the unpacker  is free to change minor class file features such as constant pool order.  However, the class files will be semantically identical, as specified in  the Java Virtual Machine Specification  http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/html/ClassFile.doc.html.  By default, the packer does not change the order of JAR elements. Also, the  modification time and deflation hint of each JAR element is passed  unchanged. (Any other ZIP-archive information, such as extra attributes  giving Unix file permissions, are lost.)  Note that packing and unpacking a JAR will in general alter the bytewise  contents of classfiles in the JAR. This means that packing and unpacking  will in general invalidate any digital signatures which rely on bytewise  images of JAR elements. In order both to sign and to pack a JAR, you must  first pack and unpack the JAR to normalize it, then compute signatures on  the unpacked JAR elements, and finally repack the signed JAR. Both packing  steps should use precisely the same options, and the segment limit may also  need to be set to -1, to prevent accidental variation of segment  boundaries as class file sizes change slightly.  (Here's why this works: Any reordering the packer does of any classfile  structures is idempotent, so the second packing does not change the  orderings produced by the first packing. Also, the unpacker is guaranteed  by the JSR 200 specification to produce a specific bytewise image for any  given transmission ordering of archive elements.)

Remarks: The VirtualPathUtility class provides utility methods for common operations involving virtual paths. For ASP.NET server controls and server code, virtual paths using the Web application root operator, the tilde (~), commonly are used instead of relative and absolute paths. For more information, see ASP.NET Web Project Paths. Use the VirtualPathUtility class when you need to convert application-relative paths to absolute virtual paths, as might be the case in developing a custom Web service handler. An absolute virtual path starts with the literal slash mark (/). A relative virtual path is relative to the application root directory, if it is just a tilde (~) or starts with the tilde and a double backslash (~\\\\) or the tilde and a slash mark (~/). Making a virtual path relative makes the path independent of the application. The virtual directory for the application can be obtained from the AppDomainAppVirtualPath and ApplicationPath properties. Note The VirtualPathUtility class is not intended for security or canonicalization purposes. For more information about Web application security, see Overview of Web Application Security Threats. For generic URL processing functionality, see Uri. Example: The following code example demonstrates how to use the VirtualPathUtility class and some of its methods.

A PKIX CertPathBuilder uses these parameters to build a CertPath which has  been validated according to the PKIX certification path validation  algorithm.  To instantiate a PKIXBuilderParameters object, an application must specify  one or more most-trusted CAs as defined by the PKIX certification path  validation algorithm. The most-trusted CA can be specified using one of two  constructors. An application can call PKIXBuilderParameters(Set,  CertSelector), specifying a Set of TrustAnchor objects, each of which  identifies a most-trusted CA. Alternatively, an application can call  PKIXBuilderParameters(KeyStore, CertSelector), specifying a KeyStore  instance containing trusted certificate entries, each of which will be  considered as a most-trusted CA.  In addition, an application must specify constraints on the target  certificate that the CertPathBuilder will attempt to build a path to. The  constraints are specified as a CertSelector object. These constraints  should provide the CertPathBuilder with enough search criteria to find the  target certificate.

Remarks: Note Beginning with the , this class is obsolete. Use BinaryFormatter instead. The SoapFormatter and BinaryFormatter classes implement the IRemotingFormatter interface to support remote procedure calls (RPCs), and the IFormatter interface (inherited by the IRemotingFormatter) to support serialization of a graph of objects. The SoapFormatter class also supports RPCs with ISoapMessage objects, without using the IRemotingFormatter functionality. During RPCs, the IRemotingFormatter interface allows the specification of two separate object graphs: the graph of objects to serialize, and an additional graph that contains an array of header objects that convey information about the remote function call (for example, transaction ID or a method signature). For proper serialization, the root object of the first graph must be an object that implements either the IMethodCallMessage interface or the IMethodReturnMessage interface. During deserialization of an RPC, a HeaderHandler delegate is specified to the Deserialize method of the formatter. The remoting infrastructure uses the HeaderHandler delegate to produce an object that supports the ISerializable interface. This object contains the information stored in the headers, and becomes the root of the graph returned by the deserializer. The SoapFormatter can also handle RPCs that are produced with objects that implement the ISoapMessage interface. To create an RPC without using the IRemotingFormatter functionality, place an object that supports the ISoapMessage interface at the root of a graph being serialized. To deserialize an RPC created in this manner the TopObject property must be set to another object that supports the ISoapMessage interface, and contains the relevant remote call information. TimeSpan Serialization TimeSpan objects are serialized according to the ISO 8601: 1998 section 5.5.3.2.1 #Alternative# standard. Version Information The SoapFormatter does not support serialization compatibility between versions of the .NET Framework. Serialization between versions 1.1 and 2.0 types in the Framework often fails. The following actions can be taken to remedy this issue: Convert to use the BinaryFormatter, which provides compatibility between 1.1 and 2.0. Convert existing persisted data to the new format. Convert all producers and consumers of serialized data to version 2.0. Avoid using types that changed from 1.1 to 2.0.

For a given factory class  name, a corresponding implementation class is searched for based on the  following algorithm. Items are listed in order of decreasing search  precedence:      * If the JavaServer Faces configuration file bundled into the WEB-INF        directory of the webapp contains a factory entry of the given factory       class name, that factory is used.      * If the JavaServer Faces configuration files named by the        javax.faces.CONFIG_FILES ServletContext init parameter contain any        factory entries of the given factory class name, those factories are       used, with the last one taking precedence.      * If there are any JavaServer Faces configuration files bundled into       the META-INF directory of any jars on the ServletContext's resource       paths, the factory entries of the given factory class name in those       files are used, with the last one taking precedence.      * If a META-INF/services/{factory-class-name} resource is visible to       the web application class loader for the calling application       (typically as a result of being present in the manifest of a JAR       file), its first line is read and assumed to be the name of the       factory implementation class to use.      * If none of the above steps yield a match, the JavaServer Faces       implementation specific class is used.  If any of the factories found on any of the steps above happen to have a  one-argument constructor, with argument the type being the abstract factory  class, that constructor is invoked, and the previous match is passed to the  constructor. For example, say the container vendor provided an  implementation of FacesContextFactory, and identified it in  META-INF/services/javax.faces.context.FacesContextFactory in a jar on the  webapp ClassLoader. Also say this implementation provided by the container  vendor had a one argument constructor that took a FacesContextFactory  instance. The FactoryFinder system would call that one-argument  constructor, passing the implementation of FacesContextFactory provided by  the JavaServer Faces implementation.  If a Factory implementation does not provide a proper one-argument  constructor, it must provide a zero-arguments constructor in order to be  successfully instantiated.  Once the name of the factory implementation class is located, the web  application class loader for the calling application is requested to load  this class, and a corresponding instance of the class will be created. A  side effect of this rule is that each web application will receive its own  instance of each factory class, whether the JavaServer Faces implementation  is included within the web application or is made visible through the  container's facilities for shared libraries.",1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,6,433,clean

Summary: Represents the method that will handle the ProfileAutoSaving event of a ProfileModule. Remarks: The ProfileAutoSaveEventHandler delegate is defined for the ProfileAutoSaving event of the ProfileModule class. You can access the ProfileAutoSaving event of the ProfileModule class in the Global.asax file for your ASP.NET application, as shown in the example for this topic. The ProfileAutoSaving event is raised at the end of page execution if the AutomaticSaveEnabled property is true. The Save method automatically determines whether properties that are made up of primitive types, strings, or DateTime objects have been changed, by checking the IsDirty property value for each SettingsPropertyValue in the user profile. However, the Save method cannot explicitly determine whether a custom class has changed. You can handle the ProfileAutoSaving event to determine whether a custom object has been modified and to continue with the automatic save for modified objects and cancel the automatic save if no objects have been modified. To cancel the automatic profile save operation, set the ContinueWithProfileAutoSave property to false in the ProfileAutoSaving event; otherwise, set the ContinueWithProfileAutoSave property to true. There may be multiple subscribers to the ProfileAutoSaving event. The ProfileModule will use the last value that the ContinueWithProfileAutoSave property is set to. As a result, it is recommended that you explicitly set the ContinueWithProfileAutoSave property in the ProfileAutoSaving event, regardless of whether you are canceling or continuing with the automatic save, as you may need to overwrite the value set by an earlier subscriber.

3336,32852,452840,456584,8,public interface Filer ,"This interface supports the creation of new files by an annotation  processor. Files created in this way will be known to the annotation  processing tool implementing this interface, better enabling the tool to  manage them. Source and class files so created will be considered for  processing by the tool after the close method has been called on the  Writer or OutputStream used to write the contents of the file. Three kinds  of files are distinguished: source files, class files, and auxiliary  resource files.  There are two distinguished supported locations (subtrees within the  logical file system) where newly created files are placed: one for new  source files, and one for new class files. (These might be specified on a  tool's command line, for example, using flags such as -s and -d.) The  actual locations for new source files and new class files may or may not be  distinct on a particular run of the tool. Resource files may be created in  either location. The methods for reading and writing resources take a  relative name argument. A relative name is a non-null, non-empty sequence  of path segments separated by '/'; '.' and '..' are invalid path segments.  A valid relative name must match the path-rootless rule of RFC 3986,  section 3.3.  The file creation methods take a variable number of arguments to allow the  originating elements to be provided as hints to the tool infrastructure to  better manage dependencies. The originating elements are the types or  packages (representing package-info files) which caused an annotation  processor to attempt to create a new file. For example, if an annotation  processor tries to create a source file, GeneratedFromUserSource, in  response to processing       @Generate public class UserSource {}   the type element for UserSource should be passed as part of the creation  method call as in:       filer.createSourceFile(GeneratedFromUserSource, eltUtils.getTypeElement(UserSource));   If there are no originating elements, none need to be passed. This  information may be used in an incremental environment to determine the need  to rerun processors or remove generated files. Non-incremental environments  may ignore the originating element information.  During each run of an annotation processing tool, a file with a given  pathname may be created only once. If that file already exists before the  first attempt to create it, the old contents will be deleted. Any  subsequent attempt to create the same file during a run will throw a  FilerException, as will attempting to create both a class file and source  file for the same type name or same package name. The initial inputs to the  tool are considered to be created by the zeroth round; therefore,  attempting to create a source or class file corresponding to one of those  inputs will result in a FilerException.  In general, processors must not knowingly attempt to overwrite existing  files that were not generated by some processor. A Filer may reject  attempts to open a file corresponding to an existing type, like  java.lang.Object. Likewise, the invoker of the annotation processing tool  must not knowingly configure the tool such that the discovered processors  will attempt to overwrite existing files that were not generated.  Processors can indicate a source or class file is generated by including an  @Generated annotation.  Note that some of the effect of overwriting a file can be achieved by using  a decorator-style pattern. Instead of modifying a class directly, the class  is designed so that either its superclass is generated by annotation  processing or subclasses of the class are generated by annotation  processing. If the subclasses are generated, the parent class may be  designed to use factories instead of public constructors so that only  subclass instances would be presented to clients of the parent class.

This allows an EIS/resource adapter to flow-in security context information  and execute a Work instance, and call methods on a MessageEndpoint  interface, to effect message inflow, within that Work instance, in the  context of an established identity.  A resource adapter indicates to the WorkManager, that a Work instance needs  to be run in a specified security execution context by submitting a Work  instance that implements WorkContextProvider interface and ensuring that  the List of WorkContexts for that Work instance contains an instance of its  subclass of Securitytext.  It should be noted however that when a resource adapter flows-in an  identity to be used by the application server, the propagated identity may  or may not belong to the application server's security domain.  There are therefore, two scenarios while a resource adapter propagates a  security identity from an EIS to the application server:      * Case 1: Resource adapter flows-in an identity in the application       server's security domain: In this case, the application server could       just set the initiating principal, flown-in from the resource       adapter, as the security context the Work instance executes as.     * Case 2: Resource adapter flows-in an identity belonging to the EIS'       security domain: The resource adapter establishes a connection to the       EIS and needs to perform a Work in the context of an EIS identity. In       this case, the initiating or caller principal does not exist in the       application server's security domain and a translation from one       domain to the other needs to be performed.

Items are listed in order of decreasing search  precedence:      * If the JavaServer Faces configuration file bundled into the WEB-INF        directory of the webapp contains a factory entry of the given factory       class name, that factory is used.      * If the JavaServer Faces configuration files named by the        javax.faces.CONFIG_FILES ServletContext init parameter contain any        factory entries of the given factory class name, those factories are       used, with the last one taking precedence.      * If there are any JavaServer Faces configuration files bundled into       the META-INF directory of any jars on the ServletContext's resource       paths, the factory entries of the given factory class name in those       files are used, with the last one taking precedence.      * If a META-INF/services/{factory-class-name} resource is visible to       the web application class loader for the calling application       (typically as a result of being present in the manifest of a JAR       file), its first line is read and assumed to be the name of the       factory implementation class to use.      * If none of the above steps yield a match, the JavaServer Faces       implementation specific class is used.  If any of the factories found on any of the steps above happen to have a  one-argument constructor, with argument the type being the abstract factory  class, that constructor is invoked, and the previous match is passed to the  constructor. For example, say the container vendor provided an  implementation of FacesContextFactory, and identified it in  META-INF/services/javax.faces.context.FacesContextFactory in a jar on the  webapp ClassLoader. Also say this implementation provided by the container  vendor had a one argument constructor that took a FacesContextFactory  instance. The FactoryFinder system would call that one-argument  constructor, passing the implementation of FacesContextFactory provided by  the JavaServer Faces implementation.  If a Factory implementation does not provide a proper one-argument  constructor, it must provide a zero-arguments constructor in order to be  successfully instantiated.  Once the name of the factory implementation class is located, the web  application class loader for the calling application is requested to load  this class, and a corresponding instance of the class will be created. A  side effect of this rule is that each web application will receive its own  instance of each factory class, whether the JavaServer Faces implementation  is included within the web application or is made visible through the  container's facilities for shared libraries.",1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,6,433,clean

3378,39987,262257,265954,7,System.Windows.Forms.Control.QueryContinueDrag,"Additional online Documentation: Syntax: public event QueryContinueDragEventHandler QueryContinueDrag Summary: Occurs during a drag-and-drop operation and enables the drag source to determine whether the drag-and-drop operation should be canceled. Remarks: The QueryContinueDrag event is raised when there is a change in the keyboard or mouse button state during a drag-and-drop operation. The QueryContinueDrag event enables the drag source to determine whether the drag-and-drop operation should be canceled. The following describes how and when events related to drag-and-drop operations are raised. The DoDragDrop method determines the control under the current cursor location. It then checks to see if the control is a valid drop target. If the control is a valid drop target, the GiveFeedback event is raised with the drag-and-drop effect specified. For a list of drag-and-drop effects, see the DragDropEffects enumeration. Changes in the mouse cursor position, keyboard state, and mouse button state are tracked. If the user moves out of a window, the DragLeave event is raised. If the mouse enters another control, the DragEnter for that control is raised. If the mouse moves but stays within the same control, the DragOver event is raised. If there is a change in the keyboard or mouse button state, the QueryContinueDrag event is raised and determines whether to continue the drag, to drop the data, or to cancel the operation based on the value of the Action property of the event's QueryContinueDragEventArgs. If the value of DragAction is Continue, the DragOver event is raised to continue the operation and the GiveFeedback event is raised with the new effect so appropriate visual feedback can be set. For a list of valid drop effects, see the DragDropEffects enumeration. Note The DragOver and GiveFeedback events are paired so that as the mouse moves across the drop target, the user is given the most up-to-date feedback on the mouse's position. If the value of DragAction is Drop, the drop effect value is returned to the source, so the source application can perform the appropriate operation on the source data; for example, cut the data if the operation was a move. If the value of DragAction is Cancel, the DragLeave event is raised. By default, the QueryContinueDrag event sets Action to Cancel in DragAction if the ESC key was pressed and sets Action to Drop in DragAction if the left, middle, or right mouse button is pressed. For more information about handling events, see Consuming Events. Example: The following code example demonstrates a drag-and-drop operation between two ListBox controls. The example calls the DoDragDrop method when the drag action starts. The drag action starts if the mouse has moved more than SystemInformation.DragSize from the mouse location during the MouseDown event. The IndexFromPoint method is used to determine the index of the item to drag during the MouseDown event. The example also demonstrates using custom cursors for the drag-and-drop operation. The example requires that two cursor files, 3dwarro.cur and 3dwno.cur, exist in the application directory, for the custom drag and no-drop cursors, respectively. The custom cursors will be used if the UseCustomCursorsCheck CheckBox is checked. The custom cursors are set in the GiveFeedback event handler. The keyboard state is evaluated in the DragOver event handler for the right ListBox, to determine what the drag operation will be based on state of the SHIFT, CTRL, ALT, or CTRL+ALT keys. The location in the ListBox where the drop would occur is also determined during the DragOver event. If the data to drop is not a String, then the DragEventArgs.Effect is set to None in DragDropEffects. Finally, the status of the drop is displayed in the DropLocationLabel Label. The data to drop for the right ListBox is determined in the DragDrop event handler and the String value is added at the appropriate place in the ListBox. If the drag operation moves outside the bounds of the form, then the drag-and-drop operation is canceled in the QueryContinueDrag event handler.

Inheritors of DbDataAdapter implement a set of functions to provide strong typing, but inherit most of the functionality needed to fully implement a DataAdapter. Remarks: The DbDataAdapter class inherits from the DataAdapter class and helps a class implement a DataAdapter designed for use with a relational database. An application does not create an instance of the DbDataAdapter interface directly, but creates an instance of a class that inherits IDbDataAdapter and DbDataAdapter. Classes that inherit DbDataAdapter must implement the inherited members, and typically define additional members to add provider-specific functionality. For example, the DbDataAdapter class defines the SelectCommand property, and the DbDataAdapter interface defines eight overloads of the Fill method. In turn, the OleDbDataAdapter class inherits the Fill method, and also defines two additional overloads of Fill that take an ADO Recordset object as a parameter. Notes to Inheritors When you inherit from the DbDataAdapter class, we recommend that you implement the following constructors: Item Description PrvDataAdapter() Initializes a new instance of the PrvDataAdapter class. PrvDataAdapter(PrvCommand selectCommand) Initializes a new instance of the PrvDataAdapter class with the specified SQL SELECT statement. PrvDataAdapter(string selectCommandText, string selectConnectionString) Initializes a new instance of the PrvDataAdapter class with an SQL SELECT statement and a connection string.

3397,32774,451129,454873,8,public interface Condition ,"Condition factors out the Object monitor methods (wait, notify and  notifyAll) into distinct objects to give the effect of having multiple  wait-sets per object, by combining them with the use of arbitrary Lock  implementations. Where a Lock replaces the use of synchronized methods and  statements, a Condition replaces the use of the Object monitor methods.  Conditions (also known as condition queues or condition variables) provide  a means for one thread to suspend execution (to wait) until notified by  another thread that some state condition may now be true. Because access to  this shared state information occurs in different threads, it must be  protected, so a lock of some form is associated with the condition. The key  property that waiting for a condition provides is that it atomically  releases the associated lock and suspends the current thread, just like  Object.wait.  A Condition instance is intrinsically bound to a lock. To obtain a  Condition instance for a particular Lock instance use its newCondition()  method.  As an example, suppose we have a bounded buffer which supports put and  take methods. If a take is attempted on an empty buffer, then the thread  will block until an item becomes available; if a put is attempted on a full  buffer, then the thread will block until a space becomes available. We  would like to keep waiting put threads and take threads in separate  wait-sets so that we can use the optimization of only notifying a single  thread at a time when items or spaces become available in the buffer. This  can be achieved using two Condition instances.   class BoundedBuffer { final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock(); final Condition notFull  = lock.newCondition();  final Condition notEmpty = lock.newCondition();   final Object[] items = new Object[100]; int putptr, takeptr, count;  public void put(Object x) throws InterruptedException { lock.lock(); try { while (count == items.length) notFull.await(); items[putptr] = x; if (++putptr == items.length) putptr = 0; ++count; notEmpty.signal(); } finally { lock.unlock(); } }  public Object take() throws InterruptedException { lock.lock(); try { while (count == 0) notEmpty.await(); Object x = items[takeptr]; if (++takeptr == items.length) takeptr = 0; --count; notFull.signal(); return x; } finally { lock.unlock(); } } }   (The ArrayBlockingQueue class provides this functionality, so there is no  reason to implement this sample usage class.)  A Condition implementation can provide behavior and semantics that is  different from that of the Object monitor methods, such as guaranteed  ordering for notifications, or not requiring a lock to be held when  performing notifications. If an implementation provides such specialized  semantics then the implementation must document those semantics.  Note that Condition instances are just normal objects and can themselves be  used as the target in a synchronized statement, and can have their own  monitor wait and notification methods invoked. Acquiring the monitor lock  of a Condition instance, or using its monitor methods, has no specified  relationship with acquiring the Lock associated with that Condition or the  use of its waiting and signalling methods. It is recommended that to avoid  confusion you never use Condition instances in this way, except perhaps  within their own implementation.  Except where noted, passing a null value for any parameter will result in a  NullPointerException being thrown.   Implementation Considerations  When waiting upon a Condition, a spurious wakeup is permitted to occur,  in general, as a concession to the underlying platform semantics. This has  little practical impact on most application programs as a Condition should  always be waited upon in a loop, testing the state predicate that is being  waited for. An implementation is free to remove the possibility of spurious  wakeups but it is recommended that applications programmers always assume  that they can occur and so always wait in a loop.  The three forms of condition waiting (interruptible, non-interruptible, and  timed) may differ in their ease of implementation on some platforms and in  their performance characteristics. In particular, it may be difficult to  provide these features and maintain specific semantics such as ordering  guarantees. Further, the ability to interrupt the actual suspension of the  thread may not always be feasible to implement on all platforms.  Consequently, an implementation is not required to define exactly the same  guarantees or semantics for all three forms of waiting, nor is it required  to support interruption of the actual suspension of the thread.  An implementation is required to clearly document the semantics and  guarantees provided by each of the waiting methods, and when an  implementation does support interruption of thread suspension then it must  obey the interruption semantics as defined in this interface.  As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for interruption  are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding to an  interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be shown  that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked the  thread. An implementation should document this behavior.

An example of  an RDN is OU=Sales+CN=J.Smith. In this example, the RDN consist of  multiple attribute type/value pairs. The RDN is parsed as described in the  class description for LdapName.  The Rdn class represents an RDN as attribute type/value mappings, which can  be viewed using Attributes. In addition, it contains convenience methods  that allow easy retrieval of type and value when the Rdn consist of a  single type/value pair, which is how it appears in a typical usage. It also  contains helper methods that allow escaping of the unformatted attribute  value and unescaping of the value formatted according to the escaping  syntax defined in RFC2253. For methods that take or return attribute value  as an Object, the value is either a String (in unescaped form) or a byte  array.  Rdn will properly parse all valid RDNs, but does not attempt to detect all  possible violations when parsing invalid RDNs. It is generous in  accepting invalid RDNs. The validity of a name is determined ultimately  when it is supplied to an LDAP server, which may accept or reject the name  based on factors such as its schema information and interoperability  considerations.  The following code example shows how to construct an Rdn using the  constructor that takes type and value as arguments:   Rdn rdn = new Rdn(cn, Juicy, Fruit); System.out.println(rdn.toString());   The last line will print cn=Juicy , Fruit. The unescapeValue() method can  be used to unescape the escaped comma resulting in the original value  Juicy, Fruit. The escapeValue() method adds the escape back preceding the  comma.  This class can be instantiated by a string representation of the RDN  defined in RFC 2253 as shown in the following code example:   Rdn rdn = new Rdn(cn=Juicy  , Fruit); System.out.println(rdn.toString());   The last line will print cn=Juicy , Fruit.  Concurrent multithreaded read-only access of an instance of Rdn need not be  synchronized.

This class cannot be inherited. Remarks: On all supported versions of SQL Server (Microsoft SQL Server 7.0, Microsoft SQL Server 2000, and SQL Server 2005) the SqlCacheDependency class monitors a specific SQL Server database table. When the table changes, items associated with the table are removed from the Cache, and a new version of the item is added to the Cache. The SqlCacheDependency class also supports integration with the System.Data.SqlClient.SqlDependency class when using a SQL Server 2005 database. The query notification mechanism of SQL Server 2005 detects changes to data that invalidate the results of an SQL query and removes any cached items associated with the SQL query from the System.Web.Caching.Cache. You can use the SqlCacheDependency class to add items to your application's Cache that are dependent on either a SQL Server database table or on an SQL query when using SQL Server 2005. You can also use this class with the @ OutputCache directive to make an output-cached page or a user control dependent on a SQL Server database table. Finally, you can use the SqlCacheDependency class with the @ OutputCache page directive to make an output-cached page dependent on the results of an SQL query when using SQL Server 2005. Query notification using SQL Server 2005 is not supported on the @ OutputCache directive for user controls. Note For this class to work correctly when using table-based notifications, the database and any tables that you want to make dependencies on must have notifications enabled. You can enable notifications by calling methods of the SqlCacheDependencyAdmin class or by using the Aspnet_regsql.exe command-line tool. In addition, the proper configuration settings must be included in the application's Web.config file. Using a SqlCacheDependency object with SQL Server 2005 query notification does not require any explicit configuration. Consult the SQL Server 2005 Books Online for information about restrictions on the types of Transact-SQL queries that are allowed when using query notification. The following example shows an ASP.NET Web.config file that enables table-based dependencies on a SQL Server database table.  Topic Location Walkthrough: Using ASP.NET Output Caching with SQL Server Building ASP .NET Web Applications in Visual Studio Example: The following code example uses the SqlDataSource and GridView controls to display a database table. When the page is loaded, the page attempts to create a SqlCacheDependency object. After the SqlCacheDependency object is created, the page adds an item to the Cache with a dependency on the SqlCacheDependency object. You should use exception handling similar to that shown here.

3428,32747,450325,454069,8,"public class ConcurrentHashMap<K,V>   ","A hash table supporting full concurrency of retrievals and adjustable  expected concurrency for updates. This class obeys the same functional  specification as Hashtable, and includes versions of methods corresponding  to each method of Hashtable. However, even though all operations are  thread-safe, retrieval operations do not entail locking, and there is not  any support for locking the entire table in a way that prevents all access.  This class is fully interoperable with Hashtable in programs that rely on  its thread safety but not on its synchronization details.  Retrieval operations (including get) generally do not block, so may overlap  with update operations (including put and remove). Retrievals reflect the  results of the most recently completed update operations holding upon their  onset. For aggregate operations such as putAll and clear, concurrent  retrievals may reflect insertion or removal of only some entries.  Similarly, Iterators and Enumerations return elements reflecting the state  of the hash table at some point at or since the creation of the  iterator/enumeration. They do not throw ConcurrentModificationException.  However, iterators are designed to be used by only one thread at a time.  The allowed concurrency among update operations is guided by the optional  concurrencyLevel constructor argument (default 16), which is used as a hint  for internal sizing. The table is internally partitioned to try to permit  the indicated number of concurrent updates without contention. Because  placement in hash tables is essentially random, the actual concurrency will  vary. Ideally, you should choose a value to accommodate as many threads as  will ever concurrently modify the table. Using a significantly higher value  than you need can waste space and time, and a significantly lower value can  lead to thread contention. But overestimates and underestimates within an  order of magnitude do not usually have much noticeable impact. A value of  one is appropriate when it is known that only one thread will modify and  all others will only read. Also, resizing this or any other kind of hash  table is a relatively slow operation, so, when possible, it is a good idea  to provide estimates of expected table sizes in constructors.  This class and its views and iterators implement all of the optional  methods of the Map and Iterator interfaces.

Remarks: The AcknowledgeTypes class provides a set of flags that you can combine to request one or more categories of acknowledgment messages. When an application sends a message, it can request that Message Queuing return acknowledgment messages indicating the success or failure of the original message. Message Queuing sends these acknowledgment messages to the administration queue you specify. Acknowledgment types can be divided broadly into four groups: positive arrival acknowledgments, positive read acknowledgments, negative arrival acknowledgments, and negative read acknowledgments. Requesting acknowledgments enables your application to receive notification of certain occurrences-for example, a message reaching its destination queue, a message being retrieved, or a time-out preventing a message from reaching or being retrieved from the destination queue. When you are using the Message class to send messages to a queue, you specify the types of acknowledgments your application should receive in the AcknowledgeType property, as well as the administration queue that receives the acknowledgment messages in the AdministrationQueue property. When you use the Message class to read acknowledgment messages in the administration queue, the instance's Acknowledgment property indicates the condition responsible for the acknowledgment message, for example, if a time-out expired before the original message was read from the queue. Example: The following code example sends and receives a message that contains an order to and from a queue. It specifically requests a positive acknowledgment when the original message reaches or is retrieved from the queue.",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,5,262,clean

The default value is true. Summary: Gets or sets a value that indicates whether the data from the data source should be stored in view state to make sure that the data has not been changed by another process before it is updated or deleted. Remarks: By default, when update and delete operations have been enabled, the LinqDataSource control stores the original values for all the records in view state. The LinqDataSource control stores values for all primary keys and all properties not marked with UpdateCheck.Never in the Column attribute. You set the UpdateCheck property of the Column attribute in the O/R Designer. Before LINQ to SQL updates or deletes data, it checks the values in view state against the current values in the data source. If the values do not match, the data source record has changed. In that case, LINQ to SQL throws an exception and does not continue with the update or delete operation. For more information about LINQ to SQL, see LINQ to SQL. Storing the original values in view state can cause the page size to become unnecessarily large and can expose sensitive data to a malicious user. You can disable storing values in view state by setting the StoreOriginalValuesInViewState property to false. If you do this, you must provide your own way to make sure that the data has not changed. If you set the StoreOriginalValuesInViewState property to false, the original values are not persisted in view state for the data-bound control. In that case, LINQ to SQL cannot verify the integrity of the data. LINQ to SQL will throw an exception that indicates a data conflict even if the data in the data source has not actually changed. If the underlying data source contains a timestamp field that is automatically updated during an update, you can store only that value in view state. In that case, the timestamp property in the entity class is set to IsVersion=true and all the properties are set to UpdateCheck.Never. Because a timestamp field is automatically updated by the database every time that data in that record changes, LINQ to SQL determines from that value if data has changed. This helps reduce the size of view state, and no sensitive data is exposed. LINQ to SQL will check for data consistency by comparing the timestamp value in view state with the timestamp value in the database.

Remarks: The ActiveDirectoryMembershipUser object is used to represent a single membership user in the Active Directory membership data store. It exposes information about the membership user such as the e-mail address, and provides functionality for the membership user such as the ability to change or reset his or her password. An ActiveDirectoryMembershipUser object is returned by the application's membership provider whenever the application is configured to use an Active Directory data store. In an application that can be configured to use different data stores, or in an application that uses multiple data stores, you can refer to the base class, MembershipUser. Because the ActiveDirectoryMembershipUser object does not implement the LastActivityDate and LastLoginDate properties, you must be prepared to handle the NotSupportedException that is thrown when these members are accessed on an ActiveDirectoryMembershipUser object. The ActiveDirectoryMembershipUser class implements internal optimizations used by the ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider class to minimize the number of attribute updates that occur when calling the UpdateUser method. It also serializes the SecurityIdentifier representation (available in the ProviderUserKey property) so that an ActiveDirectoryMembershipUser object can be serialized and deserialized without throwing exceptions. A ActiveDirectoryMembershipUser object is returned by the GetUser and CreateUser methods or as part of a MembershipUserCollection returned by the GetAllUsers, FindUsersByName, and FindUsersByEmail methods. An ActiveDirectoryMembershipUser object is required by the UpdateUser method when you want to update the information for an existing membership user. ActiveDirectoryMembershipUser properties are mapped to Active Directory attributes. The following table lists the ActiveDirectoryMembershipUser properties and their default attribute mappings. Property Default directory attribute Can be mapped? ProviderUserKey securityIdentifier No UserName userPrincipalName Yes, but must be either userPrincipalName or sAMAccountName Comment comment No CreationDate whenCreated No Email mail Yes, but must be a single-valued attribute of type Unicode String. LastActivityDate n/a Not supported by ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider. LastLoginDate n/a Not supported by ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider. LastPasswordChangedDate pwdLastSet No PasswordQuestion none, but must be mapped to an attribute if using question-and-answer security for password reset or retrieval. Yes, but must be a single-valued attribute of type Unicode String. IsApproved User-Account-Control (AD) mDS-UserAccountDisabled (ADAM) No IsLockedOut computed from lockoutTime and the AD lockout duration (AD on Windows 2000) msDS-User-Account-Control-Computed (AD on Windows Server 2003) msDS-User-Account-Control-Computed (ADAM) No LastLockoutDate If locked out due to too many bad password attempts, the lockout time attribute is returned. If locked out due to too many bad password answer attempts, the value stored in the attribute defined by attributeMapFailedPasswordAnswerLockoutTime is returned. If locked out due to both a bad password and too many bad password attempts, the most recent date/time value is returned. If the account is not locked out, return 1/1/1753 for SQL compatibility. No Example: The following code example demonstrates using properties on the ActiveDirectoryMembershipUser object on a Web page that may return user information from multiple membership data stores. Because the ActiveDirectoryMembershipUser object that underlies the MembershipUser object returned by the membership provider does not implement the LastActivityDate and LastLoginDate properties, the code first checks the type of the user object returned from the membership provider before displaying the contents of those properties.

This class is preferable to Timer  when multiple worker threads are needed, or when the additional flexibility  or capabilities of ThreadPoolExecutor (which this class extends) are  required.  Delayed tasks execute no sooner than they are enabled, but without any  real-time guarantees about when, after they are enabled, they will  commence. Tasks scheduled for exactly the same execution time are enabled  in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order of submission.  While this class inherits from ThreadPoolExecutor, a few of the inherited  tuning methods are not useful for it. In particular, because it acts as a  fixed-sized pool using corePoolSize threads and an unbounded queue,  adjustments to maximumPoolSize have no useful effect.  Extension notes: This class overrides AbstractExecutorService submit  methods to generate internal objects to control per-task delays and  scheduling. To preserve functionality, any further overrides of these  methods in subclasses must invoke superclass versions, which effectively  disables additional task customization. However, this class provides  alternative protected extension method decorateTask (one version each for  Runnable and Callable) that can be used to customize the concrete task  types used to execute commands entered via execute, submit, schedule,  scheduleAtFixedRate, and scheduleWithFixedDelay.

3474,32896,480575,484319,8,public abstract class ELResolver   ,"Enables customization of variable, property and method call resolution  behavior for EL expression evaluation.  While evaluating an expression, the ELResolver associated with the  ELContext is consulted to do the initial resolution of the first variable  of an expression. It is also consulted when a . or [] operator is  encountered.  For example, in the EL expression ${employee.lastName}, the ELResolver  determines what object employee refers to, and what it means to get the  lastName property on that object.  Most methods in this class accept a base and property parameter. In the  case of variable resolution (e.g. determining what employee refers to in  ${employee.lastName}), the base parameter will be null and the property  parameter will always be of type String. In this case, if the property is  not a String, the behavior of the ELResolver is undefined.  In the case of property resolution, the base parameter identifies the base  object and the property object identifies the property on that base. For  example, in the expression ${employee.lastName}, base is the result of the  variable resolution for employee and property is the string lastName. In  the expression ${y[x]}, base is the result of the variable resolution for  y and property is the result of the variable resolution for x.  In the case of method call resolution, the base parameter indentifies the  base object and the method parameter identifies a method on that base. In  the case of overloaded methods, the paramTypes parameter can be optionally  used to identify a method. The paramsparameter are the parameters for the  method call, and can also be used for resolving overloaded methods when the  paramTypes parameter is not specified.  Though only a single ELResolver is associated with an ELContext, there are  usually multiple resolvers considered for any given variable or property  resolution. ELResolvers are combined together using CompositeELResolvers,  to define rich semantics for evaluating an expression.  For the getValue(javax.el.ELContext, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object),  getType(javax.el.ELContext, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object),  setValue(javax.el.ELContext, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object,  java.lang.Object) and isReadOnly(javax.el.ELContext, java.lang.Object,  java.lang.Object) methods, an ELResolver is not responsible for resolving  all possible (base, property) pairs. In fact, most resolvers will only  handle a base of a single type. To indicate that a resolver has  successfully resolved a particular (base, property) pair, it must set the  propertyResolved property of the ELContext to true. If it could not handle  the given pair, it must leave this property alone. The caller must ignore  the return value of the method if propertyResolved is false.  The getFeatureDescriptors(javax.el.ELContext, java.lang.Object) and  getCommonPropertyType(javax.el.ELContext, java.lang.Object) methods are  primarily designed for design-time tool support, but must handle invocation  at runtime as well.

3502,32620,447584,451328,8,public interface ResultSet   ,"A table of data representing a database result set, which is usually  generated by executing a statement that queries the database.  A ResultSet object maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data.  Initially the cursor is positioned before the first row. The next method  moves the cursor to the next row, and because it returns false when there  are no more rows in the ResultSet object, it can be used in a while loop to  iterate through the result set.  A default ResultSet object is not updatable and has a cursor that moves  forward only. Thus, you can iterate through it only once and only from the  first row to the last row. It is possible to produce ResultSet objects that  are scrollable and/or updatable. The following code fragment, in which con  is a valid Connection object, illustrates how to make a result set that is  scrollable and insensitive to updates by others, and that is updatable. See  ResultSet fields for other options.    Statement stmt = con.createStatement( ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE); ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(SELECT a, b FROM TABLE2); // rs will be scrollable, will not show changes made by others, // and will be updatable    The ResultSet interface provides getter methods (getBoolean, getLong, and  so on) for retrieving column values from the current row. Values can be  retrieved using either the index number of the column or the name of the  column. In general, using the column index will be more efficient. Columns  are numbered from 1. For maximum portability, result set columns within  each row should be read in left-to-right order, and each column should be  read only once.  For the getter methods, a JDBC driver attempts to convert the underlying  data to the Java type specified in the getter method and returns a suitable  Java value. The JDBC specification has a table showing the allowable  mappings from SQL types to Java types that can be used by the ResultSet  getter methods.  Column names used as input to getter methods are case insensitive. When a  getter method is called with a column name and several columns have the  same name, the value of the first matching column will be returned. The  column name option is designed to be used when column names are used in the  SQL query that generated the result set. For columns that are NOT  explicitly named in the query, it is best to use column numbers. If column  names are used, the programmer should take care to guarantee that they  uniquely refer to the intended columns, which can be assured with the SQL  AS clause.  A set of updater methods were added to this interface in the JDBC 2.0 API  (JavaTM 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.2). The comments regarding  parameters to the getter methods also apply to parameters to the updater  methods.  The updater methods may be used in two ways:     1. to update a column value in the current row. In a scrollable        ResultSet object, the cursor can be moved backwards and forwards, to       an absolute position, or to a position relative to the current row.       The following code fragment updates the NAME column in the fifth row       of the ResultSet object rs and then uses the method updateRow to       update the data source table from which rs was derived.          rs.absolute(5); // moves the cursor to the fifth row of rs rs.updateString(NAME, AINSWORTH); // updates the // NAME column of row 5 to be AINSWORTH rs.updateRow(); // updates the row in the data source       2. to insert column values into the insert row. An updatable ResultSet        object has a special row associated with it that serves as a staging       area for building a row to be inserted. The following code fragment       moves the cursor to the insert row, builds a three-column row, and       inserts it into rs and into the data source table using the method        insertRow.          rs.moveToInsertRow(); // moves cursor to the insert row rs.updateString(1, AINSWORTH); // updates the // first column of the insert row to be AINSWORTH rs.updateInt(2,35); // updates the second column to be 35 rs.updateBoolean(3, true); // updates the third column to true rs.insertRow(); rs.moveToCurrentRow();    A ResultSet object is automatically closed when the Statement object that  generated it is closed, re-executed, or used to retrieve the next result  from a sequence of multiple results.  The number, types and properties of a ResultSet object's columns are  provided by the ResulSetMetaData object returned by the  ResultSet.getMetaData method.

The positions tracking change are also generally cheap to maintain. The  Position implementations (marks) store the array index and can easily  calculate the sequential position from the current gap location. Changes  only require update to the the marks between the old and new gap boundaries  when the gap is moved, so generally updating the marks is pretty cheap.

This class cannot be inherited. Remarks: The ScriptResourceAttribute class is valid only when you use it in assembly declarations. You use it to enable a specified embedded script resource in an assembly. You can define the name of the embedded script library, the name of the resource file for the script library, and the name that is used in a script file for retrieving the resource values. The ScriptManager class uses the properties in ScriptResourceAttribute to determine the correct resource name for a script library. The TypeName property is used with a resource key to specify a resource. Note The ScriptResourceAttribute class can be used only to identify text-based resources for JavaScript files. To associate a localized image (binary) file with a particular culture, consider storing only its URL as a localized resource, which then be resolved and loaded in script. Example: The following example shows a ScriptResourceAttribute attribute for a script file named CheckAnswer.js that uses resources from the VerificationResources resource files. The name Answer is used to reference these resources.  The following example shows how to use the resources in client script.

An example of  an RDN is OU=Sales+CN=J.Smith. In this example, the RDN consist of  multiple attribute type/value pairs. The RDN is parsed as described in the  class description for LdapName.  The Rdn class represents an RDN as attribute type/value mappings, which can  be viewed using Attributes. In addition, it contains convenience methods  that allow easy retrieval of type and value when the Rdn consist of a  single type/value pair, which is how it appears in a typical usage. It also  contains helper methods that allow escaping of the unformatted attribute  value and unescaping of the value formatted according to the escaping  syntax defined in RFC2253. For methods that take or return attribute value  as an Object, the value is either a String (in unescaped form) or a byte  array.  Rdn will properly parse all valid RDNs, but does not attempt to detect all  possible violations when parsing invalid RDNs. It is generous in  accepting invalid RDNs. The validity of a name is determined ultimately  when it is supplied to an LDAP server, which may accept or reject the name  based on factors such as its schema information and interoperability  considerations.  The following code example shows how to construct an Rdn using the  constructor that takes type and value as arguments:   Rdn rdn = new Rdn(cn, Juicy, Fruit); System.out.println(rdn.toString());   The last line will print cn=Juicy , Fruit. The unescapeValue() method can  be used to unescape the escaped comma resulting in the original value  Juicy, Fruit. The escapeValue() method adds the escape back preceding the  comma.  This class can be instantiated by a string representation of the RDN  defined in RFC 2253 as shown in the following code example:   Rdn rdn = new Rdn(cn=Juicy  , Fruit); System.out.println(rdn.toString());   The last line will print cn=Juicy , Fruit.  Concurrent multithreaded read-only access of an instance of Rdn need not be  synchronized.

3556,33705,460540,464284,8,public interface SyncResolver   ,"Defines a framework that allows applications to use a manual decision tree  to decide what should be done when a synchronization conflict occurs.  Although it is not mandatory for applications to resolve synchronization  conflicts manually, this framework provides the means to delegate to the  application when conflicts arise.  Note that a conflict is a situation where the RowSet object's original  values for a row do not match the values in the data source, which  indicates that the data source row has been modified since the last  synchronization. Note also that a RowSet object's original values are the  values it had just prior to the the last synchronization, which are not  necessarily its initial values.   Description of a SyncResolver Object  A SyncResolver object is a specialized RowSet object that implements the  SyncResolver interface. It may operate as either a connected RowSet object  (an implementation of the JdbcRowSet interface) or a connected RowSet  object (an implementation of the CachedRowSet interface or one of its  subinterfaces). For information on the subinterfaces, see the  javax.sql.rowset package description. The reference implementation for  SyncResolver implements the CachedRowSet interface, but other  implementations may choose to implement the JdbcRowSet interface to satisfy  particular needs.  After an application has attempted to synchronize a RowSet object with the  data source (by calling the CachedRowSet method acceptChanges), and one or  more conflicts have been found, a rowset's SyncProvider object creates an  instance of SyncResolver. This new SyncResolver object has the same number  of rows and columns as the RowSet object that was attempting the  synchronization. The SyncResolver object contains the values from the data  source that caused the conflict(s) and null for all other values. In  addition, it contains information about each conflict.   Getting and Using a SyncResolver Object  When the method acceptChanges encounters conflicts, the SyncProvider  object creates a SyncProviderException object and sets it with the new  SyncResolver object. The method acceptChanges will throw this exception,  which the application can then catch and use to retrieve the SyncResolver  object it contains. The following code snippet uses the  SyncProviderException method getSyncResolver to get the SyncResolver  object resolver.   } catch (SyncProviderException spe) { SyncResolver resolver = spe.getSyncResolver(); ... }   With resolver in hand, an application can use it to get the information it  contains about the conflict or conflicts. A SyncResolver object such as  resolver keeps track of the conflicts for each row in which there is a  conflict. It also places a lock on the table or tables affected by the  rowset's command so that no more conflicts can occur while the current  conflicts are being resolved.  The following kinds of information can be obtained from a SyncResolver  object:     1. What operation was being attempted when a conflict occurred The SyncProvider interface defines four constants describing states that  may occur. Three constants describe the type of operation (update, delete,  or insert) that a RowSet object was attempting to perform when a conflict  was discovered, and the fourth indicates that there is no conflict. These  constants are the possible return values when a SyncResolver object calls  the method getStatus.   int operation = resolver.getStatus();      2. The value in the data source that caused a conflict A conflict exists when a value that a RowSet object has changed and is  attempting to write to the data source has also been changed in the data  source since the last synchronization. An application can call the  SyncResolver method getConflictValue to retrieve the value in the data  source that is the cause of the conflict because the values in a  SyncResolver object are the conflict values from the data source.   java.lang.Object conflictValue = resolver.getConflictValue(2);   Note that the column in resolver can be designated by the column number, as  is done in the preceding line of code, or by the column name.  With the information retrieved from the methods getStatus and  getConflictValue, the application may make a determination as to which  value should be persisted in the data source. The application then calls  the SyncResolver method setResolvedValue, which sets the value to be  persisted in the RowSet object and also in the data source.   resolver.setResolvedValue(DEPT, 8390426);   In the preceding line of code, the column name designates the column in the  RowSet object that is to be set with the given value. The column number can  also be used to designate the column.  An application calls the method setResolvedValue after it has resolved all  of the conflicts in the current conflict row and repeats this process for  each conflict row in the SyncResolver object.   Navigating a SyncResolver Object  Because a SyncResolver object is a RowSet object, an application can use  all of the RowSet methods for moving the cursor to navigate a SyncResolver  object. For example, an application can use the RowSet method next to get  to each row and then call the SyncResolver method getStatus to see if the  row contains a conflict. In a row with one or more conflicts, the  application can iterate through the columns to find any non-null values,  which will be the values from the data source that are in conflict.  To make it easier to navigate a SyncResolver object, especially when there  are large numbers of rows with no conflicts, the SyncResolver interface  defines the methods nextConflict and previousConflict, which move only to  rows that contain at least one conflict value. Then an application can call  the SyncResolver method getConflictValue, supplying it with the column  number, to get the conflict value itself. The code fragment in the next  section gives an example.   Code Example  The following code fragment demonstrates how a disconnected RowSet object  crs might attempt to synchronize itself with the underlying data source and  then resolve the conflicts. In the try block, crs calls the method  acceptChanges, passing it the Connection object con. If there are no  conflicts, the changes in crs are simply written to the data source.  However, if there is a conflict, the method acceptChanges throws a  SyncProviderException object, and the catch block takes effect. In this  example, which illustrates one of the many ways a SyncResolver object can  be used, the SyncResolver method nextConflict is used in a while loop. The  loop will end when nextConflict returns false, which will occur when there  are no more conflict rows in the SyncResolver object resolver. In This  particular code fragment, resolver looks for rows that have update  conflicts (rows with the status SyncResolver.UPDATE_ROW_CONFLICT), and the  rest of this code fragment executes only for rows where conflicts occurred  because crs was attempting an update.  After the cursor for resolver has moved to the next conflict row that has  an update conflict, the method getRow indicates the number of the current  row, and the cursor for the CachedRowSet object crs is moved to the  comparable row in crs.

Remarks: The ListView.DrawSubItem event enables you to customize (or owner-draw) the appearance of a ListView control in the details view. The ListView.DrawSubItem event is raised by a ListView control when its ListView.OwnerDraw property is set to true and its View property is set to Details. The DrawListViewSubItemEventArgs passed to the event handler contains information about the ListViewItem.ListViewSubItem to draw and also provides methods to help you draw the subitem. Use the ItemState or Item properties to retrieve information about the parent item of the subitem to draw. To retrieve the ListViewItem.ListViewSubItem itself, use the SubItem property. Use the Header property to retrieve the ColumnHeader representing the header of the column in which the subitem is displayed. Use the Graphics property to do the actual drawing within the area specified by the Bounds property. To draw standard ListView elements that do not need customization, use the DrawBackground, DrawText, and DrawFocusRectangle methods. Use the DrawDefault property when you want the operating system to draw the subitem. This is useful when you want to customize only specific subitems. Note To avoid issues with graphics flickering when owner drawing, override the ListView control and set the DoubleBuffered property to true. This feature is available only on Windows XP and the Windows Server 2003 family when your application calls the Application.EnableVisualStyles method. Example: The following code example demonstrates how to provide custom drawing for a ListView control. The ListView control in the example has a gradient background. Subitems with negative values have a red foreground and a black background. A handler for the ListView.DrawItem event draws the background for entire items. A handler for the ListView.DrawSubItem event draws the text values and both the text and background for subitems that have negative values. A handler for the DrawColumnHeader event draws each column header. A ContextMenu component provides a way to switch between the details view and the list view. In the list view, only the ListView.DrawItem event is fired. In this case, the text and background are both drawn in the ListView.DrawItem event handler.

3561,33121,453294,457038,8,public class ImageReadParam   ,"A class describing how a stream is to be decoded. Instances of this class  or its subclasses are used to supply prescriptive how-to information to  instances of ImageReader.  An image encoded as part of a file or stream may be thought of extending  out in multiple dimensions: the spatial dimensions of width and height, a  number of bands, and a number of progressive decoding passes. This class  allows a contiguous (hyper)rectangular subarea of the image in all of these  dimensions to be selected for decoding. Additionally, the spatial  dimensions may be subsampled discontinuously. Finally, color and format  conversions may be specified by controlling the ColorModel and SampleModel  of the destination image, either by providing a BufferedImage or by using  an ImageTypeSpecifier.  An ImageReadParam object is used to specify how an image, or a set of  images, will be converted on input from a stream in the context of the Java  Image I/O framework. A plug-in for a specific image format will return  instances of ImageReadParam from the getDefaultReadParam method of its  ImageReader implementation.  The state maintained by an instance of ImageReadParam is independent of any  particular image being decoded. When actual decoding takes place, the  values set in the read param are combined with the actual properties of the  image being decoded from the stream and the destination BufferedImage that  will receive the decoded pixel data. For example, the source region set  using setSourceRegion will first be intersected with the actual valid  source area. The result will be translated by the value returned by  getDestinationOffset, and the resulting rectangle intersected with the  actual valid destination area to yield the destination area that will be  written.  The parameters specified by an ImageReadParam are applied to an image as  follows. First, if a rendering size has been set by setSourceRenderSize,  the entire decoded image is rendered at the size given by  getSourceRenderSize. Otherwise, the image has its natural size given by  ImageReader.getWidth and ImageReader.getHeight.  Next, the image is clipped against the source region specified by  getSourceXOffset, getSourceYOffset, getSourceWidth, and getSourceHeight.  The resulting region is then subsampled according to the factors given in  IIOParam.setSourceSubsampling. The first pixel, the number of pixels per  row, and the number of rows all depend on the subsampling settings. Call  the minimum X and Y coordinates of the resulting rectangle (minX, minY),  its width w and its height h.  This rectangle is offset by (getDestinationOffset().x,  getDestinationOffset().y) and clipped against the destination bounds. If no  destination image has been set, the destination is defined to have a width  of getDestinationOffset().x + w, and a height of getDestinationOffset().y  + h so that all pixels of the source region may be written to the  destination.  Pixels that land, after subsampling, within the destination image, and that  are written in one of the progressive passes specified by  getSourceMinProgressivePass and getSourceNumProgressivePasses are passed  along to the next step.  Finally, the source samples of each pixel are mapped into destination bands  according to the algorithm described in the comment for  setDestinationBands.  Plug-in writers may extend the functionality of ImageReadParam by providing  a subclass that implements additional, plug-in specific interfaces. It is  up to the plug-in to document what interfaces are available and how they  are to be used. Readers will silently ignore any extended features of an  ImageReadParam subclass of which they are not aware. Also, they may ignore  any optional features that they normally disable when creating their own  ImageReadParam instances via getDefaultReadParam.  Note that unless a query method exists for a capability, it must be  supported by all ImageReader implementations (e.g. source render size is  optional, but subsampling must be supported).

About registering HTTP handlers, see How to: Register HTTP Handlers. Classes can derive from the DefaultHttpHandler class to provide customized handling of requests. An asynchronous HTTP handler that is derived from the DefaultHttpHandler could override the BeginProcessRequest method to change how requests are processed.

Remarks: Encoding is the process of transforming a message into a sequence of bytes. Decoding is the reverse process. These processes require the specification of a character encoding. The WebMessageEncodingBindingElement works by delegating to a series of inner encoders to handle the plain-text XML and JSON encodings, and #raw# binary data. This delegation is done by a composite message encoder. This binding element and its composite encoder are used to control the encoding in scenarios that do not use SOAP messaging used by the WebHttpBinding. These scenarios include #Plain Old XML# (POX), Representational State Transfer (REST), Really Simple Syndication (RSS) and Atom syndication, and Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). The composite message encoder does not support SOAP or WS-Addressing, and so MessageVersion always returns None. The binding element can be configured with a write character encoding at construction time using the WebMessageEncodingBindingElement(Encoding) constructor. The Encoding value specifies the behavior on write for the JSON and Textual XML cases. On read, any valid message encoding and text encoding is understood. This constructor sets default values on the maximum number of readers and writers that are allocated to pools and that are respectively available to process incoming and outgoing messages without allocating new readers or writers. The properties MaxReadPoolSize and MaxWritePoolSize can also be used to set the maximum number of readers and writers to be allocated respectively. By default 64 readers and 16 writers are allocated. Default complexity constraints are also set by this constructor on the XmlDictionaryReaderQuotas associated with this encoding by the ReaderQuotas property to protect against a class of denial of service (DOS) attacks that attempt to use message complexity to tie up endpoint processing resources. The WebMessageEncodingBindingElement has a CreateMessageEncoderFactory method that creates a message encoder factory that produces JSON, XML or Raw message decoders and encoders as appropriate depending on the content type specified. The WebMessageEncodingBindingElement also provides the methods to build the factories and listeners for the channels through which the HTTP requests flow. The composite encoder and its associated classes and configuration components are usable in partial trust and this use does not require any special permissions.

3603,32620,447584,451328,8,public interface ResultSet   ,"A table of data representing a database result set, which is usually  generated by executing a statement that queries the database.  A ResultSet object maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data.  Initially the cursor is positioned before the first row. The next method  moves the cursor to the next row, and because it returns false when there  are no more rows in the ResultSet object, it can be used in a while loop to  iterate through the result set.  A default ResultSet object is not updatable and has a cursor that moves  forward only. Thus, you can iterate through it only once and only from the  first row to the last row. It is possible to produce ResultSet objects that  are scrollable and/or updatable. The following code fragment, in which con  is a valid Connection object, illustrates how to make a result set that is  scrollable and insensitive to updates by others, and that is updatable. See  ResultSet fields for other options.    Statement stmt = con.createStatement( ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE); ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(SELECT a, b FROM TABLE2); // rs will be scrollable, will not show changes made by others, // and will be updatable    The ResultSet interface provides getter methods (getBoolean, getLong, and  so on) for retrieving column values from the current row. Values can be  retrieved using either the index number of the column or the name of the  column. In general, using the column index will be more efficient. Columns  are numbered from 1. For maximum portability, result set columns within  each row should be read in left-to-right order, and each column should be  read only once.  For the getter methods, a JDBC driver attempts to convert the underlying  data to the Java type specified in the getter method and returns a suitable  Java value. The JDBC specification has a table showing the allowable  mappings from SQL types to Java types that can be used by the ResultSet  getter methods.  Column names used as input to getter methods are case insensitive. When a  getter method is called with a column name and several columns have the  same name, the value of the first matching column will be returned. The  column name option is designed to be used when column names are used in the  SQL query that generated the result set. For columns that are NOT  explicitly named in the query, it is best to use column numbers. If column  names are used, the programmer should take care to guarantee that they  uniquely refer to the intended columns, which can be assured with the SQL  AS clause.  A set of updater methods were added to this interface in the JDBC 2.0 API  (JavaTM 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.2). The comments regarding  parameters to the getter methods also apply to parameters to the updater  methods.  The updater methods may be used in two ways:     1. to update a column value in the current row. In a scrollable        ResultSet object, the cursor can be moved backwards and forwards, to       an absolute position, or to a position relative to the current row.       The following code fragment updates the NAME column in the fifth row       of the ResultSet object rs and then uses the method updateRow to       update the data source table from which rs was derived.          rs.absolute(5); // moves the cursor to the fifth row of rs rs.updateString(NAME, AINSWORTH); // updates the // NAME column of row 5 to be AINSWORTH rs.updateRow(); // updates the row in the data source       2. to insert column values into the insert row. An updatable ResultSet        object has a special row associated with it that serves as a staging       area for building a row to be inserted. The following code fragment       moves the cursor to the insert row, builds a three-column row, and       inserts it into rs and into the data source table using the method        insertRow.          rs.moveToInsertRow(); // moves cursor to the insert row rs.updateString(1, AINSWORTH); // updates the // first column of the insert row to be AINSWORTH rs.updateInt(2,35); // updates the second column to be 35 rs.updateBoolean(3, true); // updates the third column to true rs.insertRow(); rs.moveToCurrentRow();    A ResultSet object is automatically closed when the Statement object that  generated it is closed, re-executed, or used to retrieve the next result  from a sequence of multiple results.  The number, types and properties of a ResultSet object's columns are  provided by the ResulSetMetaData object returned by the  ResultSet.getMetaData method.

3646,34490,475538,479282,8,public abstract class GSSManager   ,"This class serves as a factory for other important GSS-API classes and also  provides information about the mechanisms that are supported. It can create  instances of classes implementing the following three GSS-API interfaces:  GSSName, GSSCredential, and GSSContext. It also has methods to query for  the list of available mechanisms and the nametypes that each mechanism  supports.  An instance of the default GSSManager subclass may be obtained through the  static method getInstance, but applications are free to instantiate other  subclasses of GSSManager. The default GSSManager instance will support the  Kerberos v5 GSS-API mechanism in addition to any others. This mechanism is  identified by the Oid 1.2.840.113554.1.2.2 and is defined in RFC 1964.  A subclass extending the GSSManager abstract class may be implemented as a  modular provider based layer that utilizes some well known service provider  specification. The GSSManager API allows the application to set provider  preferences on such an implementation. These methods also allow the  implementation to throw a well-defined exception in case provider based  configuration is not supported. Applications that expect to be portable  should be aware of this and recover cleanly by catching the exception.  It is envisioned that there will be three most common ways in which  providers will be used:     1. The application does not care about what provider is used (the       default case).    2. The application wants a particular provider to be used       preferentially, either for a particular mechanism or all the time,       irrespective of mechanism.    3. The application wants to use the locally configured providers as far       as possible but if support is missing for one or more mechanisms then       it wants to fall back on its own provider.  The GSSManager class has two methods that enable these modes of usage:  addProviderAtFront and addProviderAtEnd. These methods have the effect of  creating an ordered list of <provider, oid> pairs where each pair indicates  a preference of provider for a given oid.  It is important to note that there are certain interactions between the  different GSS-API objects that are created by a GSSManager, where the  provider that is used for a particular mechanism might need to be  consistent across all objects. For instance, if a GSSCredential contains  elements from a provider p for a mechanism m, it should generally be passed  in to a GSSContext that will use provider p for the mechanism m. A simple  rule of thumb that will maximize portability is that objects created from  different GSSManager's should not be mixed, and if possible, a different  GSSManager instance should be created if the application wants to invoke  the addProviderAtFront method on a GSSManager that has already created an  object.  Here is some sample code showing how the GSSManager might be used:   GSSManager manager = GSSManager.getInstance();  Oid krb5Mechanism = new Oid(1.2.840.113554.1.2.2); Oid krb5PrincipalNameType = new Oid(1.2.840.113554.1.2.2.1);  // Identify who the client wishes to be GSSName userName = manager.createName(duke, GSSName.NT_USER_NAME);  // Identify the name of the server. This uses a Kerberos specific // name format. GSSName serverName = manager.createName(nfs/foo.sun.com, krb5PrincipalNameType);  // Acquire credentials for the user GSSCredential userCreds = manager.createCredential(userName, GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME, krb5Mechanism, GSSCredential.INITIATE_ONLY);  // Instantiate and initialize a security context that will be // established with the server GSSContext context = manager.createContext(serverName, krb5Mechanism, userCreds, GSSContext.DEFAULT_LIFETIME);   The server side might use the following variation of this source:   // Acquire credentials for the server GSSCredential serverCreds = manager.createCredential(serverName, GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME, krb5Mechanism, GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY);  // Instantiate and initialize a security context that will // wait for an establishment request token from the client GSSContext context = manager.createContext(serverCreds);   Since:     1.4 See Also:     GSSName, GSSCredential, GSSContext",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,600,clean

Remarks: A Lookup(Of TKey, TElement) resembles a Dictionary(Of TKey, TValue). The difference is that a Dictionary(Of TKey, TValue) maps keys to single values, whereas a Lookup(Of TKey, TElement) maps keys to collections of values.

If the environment parameter to newJMXConnector contains the key        jmx.remote.protocol.provider.pkgs then the associated value is the       provider package list.    2. Otherwise, if the system property jmx.remote.protocol.provider.pkgs        exists, then its value is the provider package list.    3. Otherwise, there is no provider package list.  The provider package list is a string that is interpreted as a list of  non-empty Java package names separated by vertical bars (|). If the string  is empty, then so is the provider package list. If the provider package  list is not a String, or if it contains an element that is an empty string,  a JMXProviderException is thrown.  If the provider package list exists and is not empty, then for each element  pkg of the list, the factory will attempt to load the class      pkg.protocol.ClientProvider  If the environment parameter to newJMXConnector contains the key  jmx.remote.protocol.provider.class.loader then the associated value is the  class loader to use to load the provider. If the associated value is not an  instance of ClassLoader, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.  If the jmx.remote.protocol.provider.class.loader key is not present in the  environment parameter, the calling thread's context class loader is used.  If the attempt to load this class produces a ClassNotFoundException, the  search for a handler continues with the next element of the list.  Otherwise, a problem with the provider found is signalled by a  JMXProviderException whose cause indicates the underlying exception, as  follows:      * if the attempt to load the class produces an exception other than        ClassNotFoundException, that is the cause;     * if Class.newInstance() for the class produces an exception, that is       the cause.  If no provider is found by the above steps, including the default case  where there is no provider package list, then the implementation will use  its own provider for protocol, or it will throw a MalformedURLException if  there is none. An implementation may choose to find providers by other  means. For example, it may support the JAR conventions for service  providers, where the service interface is JMXConnectorProvider.  Every implementation must support the RMI connector protocols, specified  with the string rmi or iiop.  Once a provider is found, the result of the newJMXConnector method is the  result of calling newJMXConnector on the provider.  The Map parameter passed to the JMXConnectorProvider is a new read-only  Map that contains all the entries that were in the environment parameter to  JMXConnectorFactory.newJMXConnector, if there was one. Additionally, if the  jmx.remote.protocol.provider.class.loader key is not present in the  environment parameter, it is added to the new read-only Map. The associated  value is the calling thread's context class loader.  Since:     1.5",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,557,clean

Remarks: The CommittableTransaction class provides an explicit way for applications to use a transaction, as opposed to using the TransactionScope class implicitly. Unlike the TransactionScope class, the application writer needs to specifically call the Commit and Rollback methods in order to commit or abort the transaction. However, only the creator of a transaction can commit the transaction. Therefore, copies of a committable transaction, obtained through the Clone method are not committable. Note It is recommended that you create implicit transactions using the TransactionScope class, so that the ambient transaction context is automatically managed for you. You should also use the TransactionScope and DependentTransaction class for applications that require the use of the same transaction across multiple function calls or multiple thread calls. For more information on this model, see the Implementing An Implicit Transaction Using Transaction Scope topic. Creating a CommittableTransaction does not automatically set the ambient transaction, which is the transaction your code executes in. You can get or set the ambient transaction by calling the static Current property of the global Transaction object. For more information on ambient transactions, see the # Managing Transaction Flow using TransactionScopeOption# section of the Implementing An Implicit Transaction Using Transaction Scope topic. If the ambient transaction is not set, any operation on a resource manager is not part of that transaction. You need to explicitly set and reset the ambient transaction, to ensure that resource managers operate under the right transaction context. Until a CommittableTransaction has been committed, all the resources involved with the transaction are still locked. A CommittableTransaction object cannot be reused. Once it has been committed or rolled back, it cannot be used again in a transaction or set as the current ambient transaction context. Example: The following sample creates two new instances of CommittableTransaction, commits and rolls back them respectively.

Note   The GotFocus and LostFocus events are low-level focus events that are tied to the WM_KILLFOCUS and WM_SETFOCUS Windows messages. Typically, the GotFocus and LostFocus events are only used when updating UICues or when writing custom controls. Instead the Enter and Leave events should be used for all controls except the Form class, which uses the Activated and Deactivate events. For more information about the GotFocus and LostFocus events, see the WM_SETFOCUS and WM_KILLFOCUS topics in the #Keyboard Input Reference# section in the MSDN library at http://msdn.microsoft.com/library. Caution Do not attempt to set focus from within the Enter, GotFocus, Leave, LostFocus, Validating, or Validated event handlers.

Remarks: ASP.NET profiles offer persistent storage and retrieval of user-specific properties. Profile property values and information are stored in a data source in a manner determined by the ProfileProvider implementation. You can use the profile providers that are included with the .NET Framework (represented by the classes that derive from the ProfileProvider abstract class), or you can implement your own provider by creating a new class that derives from ProfileProvider. There are two primary reasons for creating a custom profile provider. You need to store profile information in a data source that is not supported by the profile providers included with the .NET Framework, such as a FoxPro database, an Oracle database, or other data stores. You need to manage profile information using a database schema that is different from the database schema used by the providers that ship with the .NET Framework. A common example of this would be user data that already exists in a SQL Server database for a company network or a Web site. The ProfileProvider abstract class inherits from the SettingsProvider abstract class, which inherits from the ProviderBase abstract class. Classes that implement ProfileProvider must also implement the required members of the SettingsProvider and ProviderBase abstract classes.

An instance of this class will be  returned from the getDefaultImageWriteParam methods of the built-in JPEG  ImageWriter.  The principal purpose of these additions is to allow the specification of  tables to use in encoding abbreviated streams. The built-in JPEG writer  will also accept an ordinary ImageWriteParam, in which case the writer will  construct the necessary tables internally.  In either case, the quality setting in an ImageWriteParam has the same  meaning as for the underlying library: 1.00 means a quantization table of  all 1's, 0.75 means the standard, visually lossless quantization table,  and 0.00 means aquantization table of all 255's.  While tables for abbreviated streams are often specified by first writing  an abbreviated stream containing only the tables, in some applications the  tables are fixed ahead of time. This class allows the tables to be  specified directly from client code.  Normally, the tables are specified in the IIOMetadata objects passed in to  the writer, and any tables included in these objects are written to the  stream. If no tables are specified in the metadata, then an abbreviated  stream is written. If no tables are included in the metadata and no tables  are specified in a JPEGImageWriteParam, then an abbreviated stream is  encoded using the standard visually lossless tables. This class is  necessary for specifying tables when an abbreviated stream must be written  without writing any tables to a stream first. In order to use this class,  the metadata object passed into the writer must contain no tables, and no  stream metadata must be provided. See JPEGQTable and JPEGHuffmanTable for  more information on the default tables.  The default JPEGImageWriteParam returned by the getDefaultWriteParam  method of the writer contains no tables. Default tables are included in the  default IIOMetadata objects returned by the writer.  If the metadata does contain tables, the tables given in a  JPEGImageWriteParam are ignored. Furthermore, once a set of tables has been  written, only tables in the metadata can override them for subsequent  writes, whether to the same stream or a different one. In order to specify  new tables using this class, the reset method of the writer must be called.

3760,32663,448256,452000,8,public class ChoiceFormat   ,"A ChoiceFormat allows you to attach a format to a range of numbers. It is  generally used in a MessageFormat for handling plurals. The choice is  specified with an ascending list of doubles, where each item specifies a  half-open interval up to the next item:       X matches j if and only if limit[j] <= X < limit[j+1]   If there is no match, then either the first or last index is used,  depending on whether the number (X) is too low or too high. If the limit  array is not in ascending order, the results of formatting will be  incorrect. ChoiceFormat also accepts  u221E as equivalent to infinity(INF).  Note: ChoiceFormat differs from the other Format classes in that you create  a ChoiceFormat object with a constructor (not with a getInstance style  factory method). The factory methods aren't necessary because ChoiceFormat  doesn't require any complex setup for a given locale. In fact,  ChoiceFormat doesn't implement any locale specific behavior.  When creating a ChoiceFormat, you must specify an array of formats and an  array of limits. The length of these arrays must be the same. For example,      * limits = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}       formats = {Sun,Mon,Tue,Wed,Thur,Fri,Sat}     * limits = {0, 1, ChoiceFormat.nextDouble(1)}       formats = {no files, one file, many files}       (nextDouble can be used to get the next higher double, to make the       half-open interval.)  Here is a simple example that shows formatting and parsing:       double[] limits = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}; String[] dayOfWeekNames = {Sun,Mon,Tue,Wed,Thur,Fri,Sat}; ChoiceFormat form = new ChoiceFormat(limits, dayOfWeekNames); ParsePosition status = new ParsePosition(0); for (double i = 0.0; i <= 8.0; ++i) { status.setIndex(0); System.out.println(i +  ->  + form.format(i) +  ->  + form.parse(form.format(i),status)); }   Here is a more complex example, with a pattern format:       double[] filelimits = {0,1,2}; String[] filepart = {are no files,is one file,are {2} files}; ChoiceFormat fileform = new ChoiceFormat(filelimits, filepart); Format[] testFormats = {fileform, null, NumberFormat.getInstance()}; MessageFormat pattform = new MessageFormat(There {0} on {1}); pattform.setFormats(testFormats); Object[] testArgs = {null, ADisk, null}; for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) { testArgs[0] = new Integer(i); testArgs[2] = testArgs[0]; System.out.println(pattform.format(testArgs)); }   Specifying a pattern for ChoiceFormat objects is fairly straightforward.  For example:       ChoiceFormat fmt = new ChoiceFormat( -1\#is negative| 0\#is zero or fraction | 1\#is one |1.0<is 1+ |2\#is two |2<is more than 2.); System.out.println(Formatter Pattern :  + fmt.toPattern());  System.out.println(Format with -INF :  + fmt.format(Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY)); System.out.println(Format with -1.0 :  + fmt.format(-1.0)); System.out.println(Format with 0 :  + fmt.format(0)); System.out.println(Format with 0.9 :  + fmt.format(0.9)); System.out.println(Format with 1.0 :  + fmt.format(1)); System.out.println(Format with 1.5 :  + fmt.format(1.5)); System.out.println(Format with 2 :  + fmt.format(2)); System.out.println(Format with 2.1 :  + fmt.format(2.1)); System.out.println(Format with NaN :  + fmt.format(Double.NaN)); System.out.println(Format with +INF :  + fmt.format(Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY));   And the output result would be like the following:          Format with -INF : is negative Format with -1.0 : is negative Format with 0 : is zero or fraction Format with 0.9 : is zero or fraction Format with 1.0 : is one Format with 1.5 : is 1+ Format with 2 : is two Format with 2.1 : is more than 2. Format with NaN : is negative Format with +INF : is more than 2.    Synchronization  Choice formats are not synchronized. It is recommended to create separate  format instances for each thread.

It allows an application to determine, before performing a  possibly unsafe or sensitive operation, what the operation is and whether  it is being attempted in a security context that allows the operation to be  performed. The application can allow or disallow the operation.  The SecurityManager class contains many methods with names that begin with  the word check. These methods are called by various methods in the Java  libraries before those methods perform certain potentially sensitive  operations. The invocation of such a check method typically looks like  this:       SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager(); if (security != null) { security.checkXXX(argument,  . . . ); }   The security manager is thereby given an opportunity to prevent completion  of the operation by throwing an exception. A security manager routine  simply returns if the operation is permitted, but throws a  SecurityException if the operation is not permitted. The only exception to  this convention is checkTopLevelWindow, which returns a boolean value.  The current security manager is set by the setSecurityManager method in  class System. The current security manager is obtained by the  getSecurityManager method.

Remarks: Windows Forms includes built-in accessibility support that allows your application to work with accessibility client applications. Examples of accessibility client applications include screen enlarger and reviewer utilities, voice input utilities, on-screen keyboards, alternative input devices, and keyboard enhancement utilities. The DataGridViewCheckBoxCell.DataGridViewCheckBoxCellAccessibleObject class inherits from the AccessibleObject class to provide information about a DataGridViewCheckBoxCell to accessibility client applications. Each class that represents a visual part of the DataGridView-such as DataGridViewColumnHeaderCell, DataGridViewRowHeaderCell, DataGridViewRow and DataGridViewCell-also contains a class that inherits from AccessibleObject to provide information and perform actions on behalf of accessibility client applications. There are instances when you will want to provide additional information, such as the name or description of the DataGridView control, to accessibility client applications. There are two ways of providing this additional information. To provide limited accessibility information for existing controls, set the control's AccessibleName and AccessibleDescription property values, which will be reported to accessibility client applications. Note You should change the AccessibleDefaultActionDescription and AccessibleRole property values only in rare situations, such as if you make a DataGridView look like a list. Occasionally, you might require more accessibility information or different accessibility actions to be included with your custom DataGridView or DataGridViewCell. To customize accessibility, you can write your own class that derives from the DataGridView.DataGridViewAccessibleObject or DataGridViewCell.DataGridViewCellAccessibleObject classes and override the CreateAccessibilityInstance method. For example, if you are writing a custom row header cell that implements unique custom actions, such as special hit testing within your cell, you should create a class that inherits from the DataGridViewRowHeaderCell.DataGridViewRowHeaderCellAccessibleObject class and override the CreateAccessibilityInstance method. The DataGridView exposes its data structure by using AccessibleRole values to define the data table hierarchy.

3815,33750,464857,468601,8,"public abstract class SwingWorker<T,V>   ","An abstract class to perform lengthy GUI-interacting tasks in a dedicated  thread.  When writing a multi-threaded application using Swing, there are two  constraints to keep in mind: (refer to How to Use Threads for more  details):      * Time-consuming tasks should not be run on the Event Dispatch Thread.       Otherwise the application becomes unresponsive.     * Swing components should be accessed on the Event Dispatch Thread        only.  These constraints mean that a GUI application with time intensive computing  needs at least two threads: 1) a thread to perform the lengthy task and 2)  the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT) for all GUI-related activities. This  involves inter-thread communication which can be tricky to implement.  SwingWorker is designed for situations where you need to have a long  running task run in a background thread and provide updates to the UI  either when done, or while processing. Subclasses of SwingWorker must  implement the doInBackground() method to perform the background  computation.  Workflow  There are three threads involved in the life cycle of a SwingWorker :      * Current thread: The execute() method is called on this thread. It       schedules SwingWorker for the execution on a worker thread and       returns immediately. One can wait for the SwingWorker to complete       using the get methods.      * Worker thread: The doInBackground() method is called on this thread.       This is where all background activities should happen. To notify        PropertyChangeListeners about bound properties changes use the        firePropertyChange and getPropertyChangeSupport() methods. By default       there are two bound properties available: state and progress.      * Event Dispatch Thread: All Swing related activities occur on this       thread. SwingWorker invokes the process and done() methods and       notifies any PropertyChangeListeners on this thread.  Often, the Current thread is the Event Dispatch Thread.  Before the doInBackground method is invoked on a worker thread,  SwingWorker notifies any PropertyChangeListeners about the state property  change to StateValue.STARTED. After the doInBackground method is finished  the done method is executed. Then SwingWorker notifies any  PropertyChangeListeners about the state property change to StateValue.DONE .  SwingWorker is only designed to be executed once. Executing a SwingWorker  more than once will not result in invoking the doInBackground method twice.  Sample Usage  The following example illustrates the simplest use case. Some processing is  done in the background and when done you update a Swing component.  Say we want to find the Meaning of Life and display the result in a  JLabel.   final JLabel label; class MeaningOfLifeFinder extends SwingWorker<String, Object> { @Override public String doInBackground() { return findTheMeaningOfLife(); }  @Override protected void done() { try { label.setText(get()); } catch (Exception ignore) { } } }  (new MeaningOfLifeFinder()).execute();   The next example is useful in situations where you wish to process data as  it is ready on the Event Dispatch Thread.  Now we want to find the first N prime numbers and display the results in a  JTextArea. While this is computing, we want to update our progress in a  JProgressBar.

A JAXR ConnectionFactory object is configured in a  provider-specific way to create connections with registry providers.   Looking Up a ConnectionFactory Using the JNDI API  The preferred way for a client to look up a JAXR ConnectionFactory is  within the Java Naming and Directory InterfaceTM (JNDI) API. A  ConnectionFactory object is registered with a naming service in a provider  specific way, such as one based on the JNDI API. This registration  associates the ConnectionFactory object with a logical name. When an  application wants to establish a connection with the provider associated  with that ConnectionFactory object, it does a lookup, providing the logical  name. The application can then use the ConnectionFactory object that is  returned to create a connection to the messaging provider.   Looking Up a ConnectionFactory Without Using the JNDI API  The JAXR API provides an alternative way to look up a JAXR  ConnectionFactory that does not require the use of the JNDI API. This is  done using the newInstance static method on the abstract class  ConnectionFactory provided in the JAXR API. The newInstance method returns  a JAXR ConnectionFactory. The client may indicate which factory class  should be instantiated by the newInstance method by defining the system  property javax.xml.registry.ConnectionFactoryClass.

For information about how to develop ASP.NET mobile applications, see the www.asp.net/mobile Web site. Remarks: XHTML is an XML-compliant markup that is based on HTML 4.1 and allows you to create Web sites suitable for multiple device types. It merges HTML's ease of use with XML's strict element guidelines to produce a markup language with a wide range of format and style options and reduced markup tag ambiguity. This class provides formatting capabilities that ASP.NET server controls use when rendering XHTML content to clients. The XhtmlMobileTextWriter renders markup that meets the standards of three different XHTML doc types: XHTML Basic, which supports limited style and format elements; XHTML Mobile Profile, which supports inline style sheets; and WML 2.0, which is based on XHTML 1.1 and supports cascading style sheets. This class is used primarily by developers of custom mobile page and control adapters. The XhtmlMobileTextWriter class can render all HTML elements, attributes, and style attributes, but, unlike the HtmlTextWriter class, does not allow title capitalization of these markup elements. An XhtmlPageAdapter instantiates an XhtmlMobileTextWriter and depending on the capabilities of the target device, initializes a number of properties, such as SupportsNoWrapStyle, SuppressNewLine, and UseDivsForBreaks, that assist the text writer in rendering the page and its controls. Your adapter can use a variety of methods to apply styles and control formatting: EnterStyle and ExitStyle, EnterLayout and ExitLayout, and EnterFormat and ExitFormat. Note This class derives from the MobileTextWriter class, which in turn derives from the MultiPartWriter class, and much of its functionality is provided by these base classes. You can use the members of this class, and any members it inherits from the MobileTextWriter class, to create custom text writers to use in a custom XHTML page or in class adapters. You can also create new derived classes that override the standard behavior of the XhtmlMobileTextWriter class. Device filtering is required in order to use a specific adapter or text writer for a server control. For more information about device filtering, see Architectural Overview of Adaptive Control Behavior and ASP.NET Device Filtering Overview.

3830,32698,449993,453737,8,"public interface SortedMap<K,V>   ","A Map that further provides a total ordering on its keys. The map is  ordered according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator  typically provided at sorted map creation time. This order is reflected  when iterating over the sorted map's collection views (returned by the  entrySet, keySet and values methods). Several additional operations are  provided to take advantage of the ordering. (This interface is the map  analogue of SortedSet.)  All keys inserted into a sorted map must implement the Comparable  interface (or be accepted by the specified comparator). Furthermore, all  such keys must be mutually comparable: k1.compareTo(k2) (or  comparator.compare(k1, k2)) must not throw a ClassCastException for any  keys k1 and k2 in the sorted map. Attempts to violate this restriction will  cause the offending method or constructor invocation to throw a  ClassCastException.  Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map (whether or not an  explicit comparator is provided) must be consistent with equals if the  sorted map is to correctly implement the Map interface. (See the  Comparable interface or Comparator interface for a precise definition of  consistent with equals.) This is so because the Map interface is defined in  terms of the equals operation, but a sorted map performs all key  comparisons using its compareTo (or compare) method, so two keys that are  deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted map,  equal. The behavior of a tree map is well-defined even if its ordering is  inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general contract of the  Map interface.  All general-purpose sorted map implementation classes should provide four  standard constructors: 1) A void (no arguments) constructor, which  creates an empty sorted map sorted according to the natural ordering of its  keys. 2) A constructor with a single argument of type Comparator, which  creates an empty sorted map sorted according to the specified comparator.  3) A constructor with a single argument of type Map, which creates a new  map with the same key-value mappings as its argument, sorted according to  the keys' natural ordering. 4) A constructor with a single argument of type  SortedMap, which creates a new sorted map with the same key-value mappings  and the same ordering as the input sorted map. There is no way to enforce  this recommendation, as interfaces cannot contain constructors.  Note: several methods return submaps with restricted key ranges. Such  ranges are half-open, that is, they include their low endpoint but not  their high endpoint (where applicable). If you need a closed range (which  includes both endpoints), and the key type allows for calculation of the  successor of a given key, merely request the subrange from lowEndpoint to  successor(highEndpoint). For example, suppose that m is a map whose keys  are strings. The following idiom obtains a view containing all of the  key-value mappings in m whose keys are between low and high, inclusive:   SortedMap<String, V> sub = m.subMap(low, high+ 0);  A similar technique can be used to generate an open range (which contains  neither endpoint). The following idiom obtains a view containing all of the  key-value mappings in m whose keys are between low and high, exclusive:   SortedMap<String, V> sub = m.subMap(low+ 0, high);  This interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework.
